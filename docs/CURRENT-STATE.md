## Where we are (leaving s49)

A working **Node daemon + web dashboard**. The core loop (P1) and dashboard (P2) are
shipped; the attended **live-orchestrator presence** (chat as the project's main
screen) is shipped; the **unattended-autonomy half** of `adr/004` is partly built (2 of
~5 slices). `main` is clean and synced through s48 (`22585ef`).

**s49 built `adr/006` Phase 1 — the first Authority-Model enforcement increment.** The
machine gate no longer reads its oracle *definitions* (contract zones, guards, recipes,
the constitution path list) from the worktree the worker just wrote; it reads them from
the trusted root and only *executes* against the worktree. Fail-closed on a
configured-but-unreadable oracle; `contract.constitutionPaths` is wired (was dead
config); realpath containment on both the read and the stub-write path. Four codex
`gpt-5.6-luna` rounds, live-proven end-to-end. Next priority is unchanged: **Profiles /
WP-WC Qualification Layer** (Track A) — the Authority Model prerequisite it depends on
is now materially closer.

## Phase status

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Core loop (P1, headless) | ✅ shipped, parity-proven against the PS oracle |
| Web dashboard (P2) | ✅ product-track items 1–4 done; general polish ongoing |
| Attended live-orchestrator presence (`adr/004`) | ✅ shipped (s40, PR #72) |
| Unattended autonomy (`adr/004`) | 🚧 partly built — see below |
| Critic model | ✅ codex `gpt-5.6-luna` (calibrated s44; **pin it**) |

**Unattended-autonomy half (`adr/004`) — built vs remaining:**
- ✅ Slice 1 — overnight escalation supervisor (deterministic reason-routing, s45)
- ✅ Slice 2 — overnight presence toggle (global presence × per-project opt-in, s46)
- ⬜ Morning report (batch-narrate `.autodev/decision-journal.ndjson`, reuses the s40 narrator)
- ⬜ Per-project **north-star** concept doc (onboarding-created anti-drift anchor)
- ⬜ Mandatory anti-drift critic (intent vs cumulative diff)

## What s49 delivered (`adr/006` Phase 1 — oracle definition integrity)

- **`gateDeps` reads definitions from `repoRoot`** — `loadInvariants`, `loadGuardPairs`,
  and `guardStillRed`'s guard-pair *selection* (the codex-flagged bypass a loader-only
  refactor would leave). Execution (check command, success commands, agent-ci, the
  mutation run) stays against `wt.path`. Symmetric with `zonesTouchedInDiff` at last.
- **Fail closed** — a contract file *explicitly configured in the raw YAML* but absent,
  escaping the trusted root, or reached through a symlink now throws (→ escalate).
  Not-configured + absent stays legitimate. Needs the RAW config: zod defaults both keys.
- **`contract.constitutionPaths` wired** (Finding 2 — dead since the schema shipped),
  unioned + deduped with the INVARIANTS constitution globs.
- **`src/util/path-contain.ts`** — realpath containment shared by the oracle read path
  and the stub-write path (a lexical `join` clamps neither `..` nor a symlinked
  ancestor); win32-only case folding; full trailing-separator normalization.
- **Migration** — the scaffold always configured `guardsFile` but never wrote it, so
  fail-closed alone would have bricked every existing project. `ensureContractStubs`
  (serve startup) heals `GUARDS.md` only, and only when verified git-ignored +
  realpath-contained. `INVARIANTS.md` is deliberately never healed.
- **4 codex `gpt-5.6-luna` rounds**, each finding a narrower leak in the previous fix
  (lexical containment → healed invariants = vacuous pass → lexical check re-leaked into
  the write path → unverified git-ignore assumption). TOCTOU-on-read declined as a
  documented accepted residual. 1207 tests green.
- **Live-proven** on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`: the startup migration self-healed
  the real project (INFO log), then a zone declared ONLY at the trusted root escalated a
  real task — `decision: ESCALATE`, `zone 'shipping-method-ids' touched … needs guard` —
  with no INVARIANTS file in the worktree at all. Pre-Phase-1 that run committed vacuously.
- **Docs** — `AGENTS.md` merge policy reconciled (attended = operator's merge word;
  unattended = standing auto-merge grant); GOTCHAS 71→72.

## What s48 delivered (Authority Model audit + `adr/006`)

- **Audit** (`wiki/authority-model-audit-2026-07.md`) — traced worker write-scope vs the
  oracle in code. **Sound (5 items):** task contract + gate config live in git-excluded
  `.autodev` (worker-inaccessible); the fence bounds writes to `file_set`; routing reads
  main-root INVARIANTS. **5 holes:** (1) the gate reads oracle *definitions* from the
  worktree; (2) `contract.constitutionPaths` is dead config; (3) scaffold points contract
  files at git-excluded `.autodev/…` → absent from worktree → gate zone checks vacuous
  (verified live); (4) no capability/protected-paths model; (5) missing oracle fails open.
- **`adr/006`** — capability-based Authority Model: oracle *definitions* from a trusted
  root, *execution* against the worktree, *changes* via operator bless. Phased enforcement
  (not built s48): Phase-1 definition integrity · Phase-2 executable-input protected-paths ·
  Phase-3 profiles.
- **`PRINCIPLES.md` +2** — #14 "worker does not write its own oracle" (write-authority,
  distinct from #2) + #15 "gate proves only formalized properties" (review risk 3). 15 total.
- **codex `gpt-5.6-luna` reviewed the audit + ADR** — corrected an overstated CI claim,
  scoped the "sound" framing (executable-input tampering ≠ closed by trusted-root reads),
  and flagged the `guardStillRed` bypass + fail-open. All folded in.

## The thrust — Authority Model → Profiles (from the external review)

`wiki/architecture-review-external-2026-07.md` details it. The chain, order load-bearing:

```text
Authority Model  →  Profiles / Qualification Layer  →  two reports  →  Evaluation Corpus
```

- **Authority Model** — audited s48; formalized in `adr/006`; enforcement phased (Phase-1
  is a queued gated task, not yet built). This is the prerequisite the profiles thrust
  depends on (a profile over an unprotected oracle is theater).
- **Profiles / Qualification Layer** — a reusable per-project-type proof pack (WP/WC
  first): the harness proves the *process*, the profile proves the *product*. Our
  `gate.agentCi` is the substrate; a profile productizes it. (The `adr/004` **north-star**
  doc likely folds into this.)

## NEXT ACTIONS

- **s50 (priority) — Profiles / WP-WC Qualification Layer:** brainstorm→spec→build
  (depends on the Authority Model; can interleave with Phase-1). Fold in the `adr/004`
  north-star concept. Phase-2/3 protected-paths land here.
- **Remaining `adr/004` slices** (after/interleaved, each own brainstorm→spec→plan):
  morning report · mandatory anti-drift · (north-star → folded into profiles).
- **Metrics / Evaluation Corpus** (GPT suggestion, decide if/when): autonomy-%,
  rework-cycles, first-pass gate-success, critic FP/FN — the numbers that prove the gate.
- **Carried:** agent-ci synthetic `GITHUB_REPO` for non-GitHub repos · overloaded
  `blocked` EscalationType (v1 parks all) · chat-runtime → TanStack AI + AG-UI (`FUTURE-BACKLOG`).

## Open questions

- **`adr/006` Phase 2 (executable-input protected paths)** — when? It is the half Phase 1
  deliberately leaves open (guard test files, `success_command` scripts, workflow
  implementations still run from the worktree). Phase 3 folds into Profiles.
- *(closed s49)* s45 PR status → PR #76 merged 17.07. Merge policy → reconciled in `AGENTS.md`.

## Recent sessions (full detail → `SESSION-LOG.md`)

- **s49** — `adr/006` Phase 1 shipped: oracle definitions read from the trusted root, fail-closed, `constitutionPaths` wired, realpath containment, `GUARDS.md` migration; 4 luna rounds; live-proven (trusted-root zone escalated a real task). GOTCHAS 71→72. `AGENTS.md` merge policy reconciled.
- **s48** — Authority Model audit (5 sound / 5 holes, worker write-scope vs the oracle) + `adr/006` (capability model, phased enforcement) + `PRINCIPLES.md` +2 (#14/#15); codex-luna-reviewed; GOTCHAS 70→71. Merged to `main` (`c6c2343`).
- **s47** — docs consolidation (stale foundation fixed · CURRENT-STATE 139 KB→8 KB · `PRINCIPLES.md` added) + external agent review processed → Authority-Model→Profiles thrust defined. Merged to `main` (`7759346`).
- **s46** — overnight presence toggle (`adr/004` slice 2): global settings store + sidebar UI + daemon wiring; 4-pass luna gate; live-proven. PR #77 merged (`680b9fa`), CI 4/4. GOTCHAS 69→70.
- **s45** — 2 carried fixes + overnight escalation supervisor (`adr/004` slice 1); 4-pass luna gate; live-proven twice. Branch `autodev/s45-carried-items` (PR status open, see above).
- **s44** — `gpt-5.6-luna` promoted as critic (calibrated 12/12) + reply-B poison-fix.
- **s43** — reply-B cycle live-proven + `blocked`-state shipped (PR #74).
- **s42** — critic-is-a-correctness-gate (`adr/005`) + reply-B carries critic feedback (PR #73).
- **s41** — first real CI run on a real task, operator-observable end-to-end → DONE (`3609a2c`); 4 findings.
- **s40** — attended live-orchestrator presence shipped, chat = main screen (PR #72).

## Environment (verified s46)

- **Daemon:** `node dist/index.js serve` (:4319, daemon-global, serves `dist/ui`) or `node dist/index.js run` (headless, from the project dir). **Rebuild BOTH bundles** after backend changes (`npm run build` AND `npm run build:ui`).
- **Presence store:** `~/.autodev/settings.json` (`{overnight:{enabled}}`); `GET`/`PATCH /settings`. Per-project opt-in: `autonomy.overnight.enabled` in the project `.autodev/config.yaml`. Overnight runs on the AND, presence read fresh per trigger.
- **Test repo:** `woodev-shipping-plugin-test` (registry `~/.autodev/projects.json`, path `D:\Projects\wordpress\woodev-shipping-plugin-test`, on `autodev/main`). `.autodev` is git-excluded, so seeding never dirties the tree.
- **Critic:** codex via the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent — **pin `--model gpt-5.6-luna`**.
