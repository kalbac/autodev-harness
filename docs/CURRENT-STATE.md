## Direction (as of s02 — see `adr/002`)

**Not forking AO.** Building our **own Node LTS + TypeScript harness** = headless
daemon (a TS port of our proven autodev-loop) + local web UI, **file-blackboard as the
single source of truth**, assembling the verified best-of from four donors. Skeleton is
**frozen** (6 axes, codex-verified). Mission/discipline unchanged.

## Phase

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| P0 — Bootstrap docs & charter | ✅ done (s01) |
| Pivot — build-own vs fork; donor extraction; freeze skeleton | ✅ done (s02, `adr/002`) |
| **P1 — Core loop (headless TS daemon)** | ✅ **DONE (s09).** Behavioral parity with the PS oracle on the fixture (18-scenario parity harness) AND one live real-repo workload (aurora → green COMMIT, live claude+codex) + CI green cross-platform. 272 tests. |
| P2 — Web UI (localhost dashboard over the core) | ⬜ pending |
| P3 — Product phase (Electron/Tauri wrap + grafts) | ⬜ pending |

## Frozen skeleton (codex-verified — do not re-litigate without cause)

1. **State:** file-blackboard = truth (git-tracked), behind `BlackboardRepository` seam.
2. **Worker interface:** pluggable `WorkerAdapter`/`CriticAdapter`; MVP = `claude` + `codex`.
3. **Checkpoint:** conductor commits-to-branch **after** gate; `Checkpoint` seam → PR later.
4. **Isolation:** per-task `git worktree` (AO pattern), non-destructive teardown.
5. **Gate:** independent diff-critic + machine gate; **self-critique rejected**; `GateExtension` seam → action-level risk.
6. **Routing:** declarative per-task `model:` (no donor does complexity routing); `Router` seam → BYOK.

## Last session (s11, 2026-07-02)

- **R3 role registry SHIPPED (PR #21, merged `d07e72c`).** Flat `worker:`/`critic:` config blocks generalized into
  a unified `roles: {orchestrator, worker, critic, planner}` registry + `policy.heterogeneity` (warn|off). Worker
  keeps its `ladder` (parity §7 intact); orchestrator/planner are config-only (planner reserved, R2). New
  `src/config/roles.ts` (adapter metadata/family/exe resolution, `assertKnownAdapters` fail-loud, heterogeneity
  policy). Root schema `.strict()` (stale flat configs fail LOUD, not silent-revert) + `ladder.min(1)`. All 6
  consumers migrated. codex GPT-5.5 gate: 2 findings fixed + regression tests, 1 declined w/ rationale, re-critic
  clean. typecheck clean, 287 tests, CI green 4/4 (win+linux × node 20/22). aurora `.autodev/config.yaml` migrated.
- **AGENTS.md** added to CLAUDE.md session-start protocol (was missing).
- **R1/R2 orchestrator layer:** design in progress. ADR fixes the 4 capabilities (enqueue/trigger/read/report) but
  leaves genuine forks open (execution model, entry point, orchestrator-adapter shape, headless "report") →
  surfacing 🔴 to operator before coding.

## Prior session (s10, 2026-07-02)

- **`adr/003` design gate passed → accepted.** All 4 open questions resolved with the operator:
  - **R1 boundary — orchestrator STRICTLY ABOVE.** LLM touches enforcement via exactly 4 caps (enqueue task
    file / trigger loop / read state / report+kanban); every step claim→worktree→worker→harvest→fence→critic→
    gate→commit stays in the pure-code conductor. No `run_worker`/`run_critic`/`run_gate`/`commit` tool. Preserves
    the PS-oracle "can't talk past the gate" guarantee 1:1.
  - **R2 planner — folded into orchestrator for MVP**, reserved as a registry role id; output contract = the same
    `queue/pending/*.md` the scheduler understands.
  - **R3 config — unified `roles:` registry** (`{adapter,model,effort?,exe?}` per role) + global defaults + sparse
    per-project override; flat `worker`/`critic` blocks migrate in; `policy.heterogeneity: warn` (default).
  - **R4 orchestrator session/window model — deferred to P2** (window-shaped, over the read-only `api` seam).
- No code this session by design (design gate, not a build sprint). `VISION.md` role-model banner + this file updated.

## NEXT ACTIONS (s11 → s12)

1. ✅ **DONE — role registry + per-adapter config (adr/003 R3).** Shipped in PR #21 (merged `d07e72c`). See Last session.
2. **IN PROGRESS — orchestrator layer (adr/003 R1/R2):** additive LLM layer above the conductor with exactly the 4
   capabilities (enqueue/trigger/read/report) on the existing scheduler + run entrypoint + `api` read seam. Design
   underway; skeleton-shaping forks (execution model / entry point / orchestrator-adapter / headless report) to be
   operator-approved before coding. Then full discipline (impl → spec-check → codex gate → re-critic).
3. **Optional P1 hardening — Finding #1 (deps-provisioning):** symlink/junction configured dirs (`vendor/`,
   `node_modules/`, `.env`, sqlite) into each worktree before the gate → gates graduate `php -l` → `php artisan test`.
   Not a blocker. codex-gated.
4. **P2** (localhost dashboard over the read-only `api` seam; carries the R4 orchestrator window model) / P3.

**Assets:** all P1 modules under `src/{util,config,blackboard,scheduler,worktree,router,worker,critic,watchdog,
escalate,anti-drift,gate,conductor,api}/` + `src/index.ts` (composition root). Parity harness under
`test/parity/`. CI at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; asset copy at `scripts/copy-assets.mjs`. The loop runs
end-to-end and is behavior-pinned to the PS oracle on the fixture. Known deferred limits: gotcha
`[conductor/wiring]`.

## Continuity (do not break)

The **existing PowerShell autodev-loop** (`D:/Projects/woodev_framework/tools/autodev/*.ps1`)
keeps running our real tasks until P1 reaches parity. It is the **parity oracle** — untouched.

## Assets on disk

- `references/` — 5 donor clones (git-ignored; URLs + pinned SHAs in `references/MANIFEST.md`).
  Note gotcha: OpenHands real code is in `references/software-agent-sdk/`.
- `docs/superpowers/donor-extraction/` — 5 briefs, `decision-matrix.md` (VERIFIED),
  `codex-verification.md`, `autodev-loop-parity-spec.md`.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-harness-p1-core-loop-design.md` — the P1 design.

## Open questions

- ✅ **RESOLVED (s10) → `adr/003` ACCEPTED.** Role model = configurable matrix + LLM orchestrator.
  Answers: (R1) orchestrator sits **strictly above** the pure-code conductor — 4 caps only
  (enqueue/trigger/read/report), enforcement steps un-bypassable; (R2) `planner` **folded into the
  orchestrator for MVP**, reserved as a registry role, output = `queue/pending/*.md`; (R3) unified
  **`roles:` registry** (`{adapter,model,effort?,exe?}`) + global defaults + sparse per-project
  override + `policy.heterogeneity: warn`; (R4) orchestrator window/session model **deferred to P2**.
  Build order: role registry/config first (s11), then the orchestrator layer.
- ✅ **RESOLVED (s05) → (b).** Gate/recipe design: confirmed from real `.autodev/GUARDS.md` + recipe files
  that the table's `contract_value` cell is human-facing (can list `+`-joined siblings; yandex row lists two
  values but the recipe carries one `canonical_value`) while the machine per-value key is `recipe.canonical_value`,
  and `zone_id` lives ONLY in the recipe. `guards.ts` = pure fs-free table parser + selectors over enriched
  `GuardRecipePair[]`; `gate.ts` owns recipe loading (mirrors PS `Get-AutodevGuards` + `Get-AutodevGuardRecipePairs`
  + pure `Select-*`). Matching the raw `contract_value` cell would have falsely covered a sibling value —
  (b) is required for divergence-#2 correctness, not just cleaner.
- ✅ **RESOLVED (s09).** Live P1 parity target = `aurora` (disposable Laravel sandbox in `d:/projects/`,
  operator-designated as abandoned/deletion-candidate → free to use). Green COMMIT proven end-to-end.
- Repo hosting/licensing details for `kalbac/autodev-harness`.
- Exact per-project config file format (`.autodev/config.yaml` vs `harness.config.*`).
