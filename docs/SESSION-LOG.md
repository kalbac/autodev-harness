## s54 (2026-07-24) — MANDATORY ANTI-DRIFT + NORTH-STAR: the last unattended-autonomy slice of adr/004 (impl + live-proven; awaiting merge word)

Implemented the s53 spec on `feat/mandatory-anti-drift`. This closes the unattended-autonomy half of `adr/004` (all four slices now shipped). Main-session implementation (the pieces are tightly coupled — conductor policy + supervisor wiring + root wiring must be coherent — so a fan-out was riskier than a single coherent pass), TDD, then the mandatory independent codex `gpt-5.6-luna` gate.

- **What shipped.** New pure `src/anti-drift/north-star.ts` (`isNorthStarSilent` + a sentinel shared with `scaffold.ts`). `intentSource` default `null` → `.autodev/GOAL.md` (arms the previously-toothless anti-drift out of the box); `GOAL_STUB` restructured to the 4-part north-star (what/why/must-do/must-never) each carrying an "unfilled" sentinel. `ConductorRunOptions.antiDrift` policy (default = today's attended behavior): a **north-star preflight** (`requireNorthStar`) refuses to claim any task when the north-star is silent → synthetic `blocked` escalation + a decision-journal park, zero worker tokens; **halt-on-drift** (`onDrift: "halt-drain"`) escalates a DRIFT AND breaks the drain. The overnight supervisor is the sole caller setting the unattended policy, via a new exported `supervisorDrainOpts` (spread last → not operator-overridable). A shared `makeIntentReader` resolves the intent path against the trusted repoRoot for BOTH the anti-drift model check and the preflight. Both new outcomes surface in the morning report as parks. Attended is byte-for-byte unchanged (regression-pinned).
- **Codex gate — R1 NOT SAFE → fix → R2 SAFE.** R1 found the one real bug: an operator's explicit `intentSource: ""` → `resolve(repoRoot, "")` returns repoRoot → `existsSync(repoRoot)` true → `readFile(<a directory>)` throws EISDIR → crashes attended anti-drift (getIntent doesn't catch). The old `existsSync(p) ? readFile(p) : null` was accidentally safe (`existsSync("")` false); adding `resolve` reopened it. Fixed by extracting `makeIntentReader` (empty/whitespace short-circuits to null BEFORE resolve; ANY read error → null; exported + unit-pinned) → GOTCHAS 81 `[path/empty-resolves-to-root]`. R2 verified the fix fully closes it, no residual. 1673 tests green (15 new), typecheck + both bundles clean.
- **Live-proven three ways on the polygon** (`woodev-shipping-plugin-test`, unattended path = presence AND per-project opt-in). (A) Silent GOAL + a claimable pending task → **refused before any claim**, task stayed pending, `blocked` escalation + park, morning report narrated "no north star… before I can start running autonomously". (B) Filled GOAL + empty queue → **no false refuse**, clean idle drain. (C) The heavy one — a real task that CREATED a new postal-tracking class file (proven-committing shape) against a **courier-only** north-star → worker→critic→gate→**commit** → anti-drift `sonnet` returned **DRIFT** → **the drain halted**, the second (courier) queued task **stayed pending** and its file was never created, and the morning report narrated "it caught itself adding a postal-only tracking helper class that directly violates the courier-only scope… and halted the drain before it went further".
- **Live-proof staging lessons (polygon):** the contract-zone glob `includes/class-test-shipping-method-*.php` covers every method file with no blessed guard → any edit there escalates `needs-guard` (not a commit), so the first DRIFT attempt's docblock task never committed; and every easy non-zone file already had a docblock. The reliable committing-yet-drifting shape was a NEW demo class file (matches the proven `fb21553` pattern) whose subject (postal) contradicts the north-star. Polygon fully restored after (HEAD reset off the proof commit, config/GOAL/presence/queue back to baseline; `.autodev` is git-excluded so the tree never dirtied).

## s53 (2026-07-24) — TAIL-CLOSING: CRLF papercut (merged) + Morning Report (merged) + Mandatory-Anti-Drift spec (impl next session)

Operator's plan: "close tails 2 and 3, then Evaluation Corpus (1)". Two full brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent→codex-critic→live-proof→merge cycles landed; the third slice is spec'd and handed off. All subagent-driven (Sonnet 5 workers, TDD; codex `gpt-5.6-luna` critic).

- **Tail #3 — CRLF-vs-WPCS papercut, MERGED (PR #114, squash `2a0b326`, CI 4/4).** A worker on Windows writes a new `.php` in CRLF; WPCS `Generic.Files.LineEndings` reds line 1, and for a NEW file line 1 is worker-added so line-scoping can't filter it. Decided WITH the operator: **normalize, don't blind the sniff** (the committed product should be LF, which WordPress wants). New `src/normalize/eol.ts` rewrites `\r\n`→`\n` in the worker's changed files, after the fences, before the diff/gate, governed by the target repo's `.gitattributes` (`git check-attr`, default LF). Codex R1 → NOT SAFE (unguarded catch-logger breaks "never-throws"; no worktree-containment guard before read/write) → both fixed; R2 confirmed + a TOCTOU residual declined-and-documented (same realpath→fsop gap the oracle fence accepts). Evidence ladder: 15 unit + conductor integration, real-git smoke 10/10, real-WPCS causal (CRLF exit 2 → LF exit 0), and **live harness activation** — a worker's CRLF new file → conductor log `normalized CRLF->LF` → phpcs green → DONE+commit `fb21553`, committed file LF.
- **Tail #2 slice 1 — Morning Report, MERGED (PR #115, squash `d8badd4`, CI 4/4).** The third report type (after s52's Execution + Qualification): narrate the overnight supervisor's `decision-journal.ndjson` (auto-rework/park), reconciled against the LIVE blackboard (Principle 11 — journal says what was DECIDED, the queue says where the task IS; queue wins). CLI `report morning [--since]` + `GET /projects/:id/morning-report`; pure builder + tolerant parser + fail-closed narration (reuses the s40 orchestrator narrator). Codex R1 → NOT SAFE, 3 Major: **lexicographic ISO compare** (wrong for timezone offsets), **journal read masking EACCES as empty** (fail-open), **throwing logger in the fail-closed narration catch** (`[ts/fail-closed]` again) → all fixed (Date.parse epoch compare; ENOENT-only swallow; guarded logger; `--since` validated at both boundaries). R2 → fixes SAFE + one endpoint hardening (reject a repeated `?since=`). Live-proven deterministically on the polygon: a parked-but-now-`done` task reconciles to done (not needs-you), a live-escalated task lands under "Needs you", an unlocatable task reads "unknown", and the real narrator produced a warm paragraph over the *reconciled* state.
- **Tail #2 slice 2 — Mandatory Anti-Drift + North-Star, SPEC WRITTEN (impl next session, `feat/mandatory-anti-drift`).** Anti-drift already runs (every `everyCommits`, DRIFT→escalate) but `intentSource` defaults `null` → toothless; `.autodev/GOAL.md` is scaffolded but generic and unwired. Decided WITH the operator: (1) a DRIFT in **unattended** mode **halts the overnight drain** (not just parks one task — cumulative drift = wrong direction, stop burning the night); (2) an empty/stub north-star **fails closed** in unattended (refuse to run — can't autonomously build a project with no written intent). Attended unchanged. Design: `intentSource` defaults to `.autodev/GOAL.md`; a 4-part north-star stub with a detectable "unfilled" sentinel; an anti-drift POLICY in the conductor run-opts (`onDrift: escalate-task|halt-drain`, `requireNorthStar`) set by the overnight supervisor; both new outcomes surface in the morning report. All above the gate (adr/003 R1). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-mandatory-anti-drift-north-star-design.md`.
- **Process notes:** `git add -A` in a subagent commit swept operator-added files (`opencode.json` + `package.json`/lock, his OpenCode config) into a commit — caught and split out; lesson: stage explicit paths, not `-A`, on a shared working tree. The `[ts/fail-closed]` gotcha (guard the catch-block logger) recurred in BOTH new modules and was flagged by codex both times — it is the single most repeated defect shape in this repo alongside "validated one string, used another".

## s52 (2026-07-22/23) — THE TWO REPORTS: separate a successful Run from a successful Product (PR open, awaiting merge word)

Third link of the `architecture-review-external-2026-07.md` chain (Authority Model -> Profiles -> **two reports** -> Evaluation Corpus). Branch `feat/two-reports`, 20 commits, 1611 tests green, typecheck clean. Live-proven on the polygon; awaiting the operator's merge word (attended).

- **The framing, decided WITH the operator then handed to me:** two reports, never mixed. A **Harness Execution Report** (per-run diagnostics: rounds, critic, gate, tokens — stale within a day) and a **Product Qualification Report** (per-commit-range, on-demand — the asset). He chose different-readers/different-lifetimes (B) and the commit-scoped-with-stated-limits section framing (A), then said "stop asking, decide yourself." Everything after was mine.
- **The load-bearing design call:** both reports are pure functions over a new per-task **evidence ledger** (`runtime/<taskId>/evidence.json`), written ONCE per iteration from a mutable draft in the conductor's `finally` (default outcome `abandoned`), cleared before work so a failed fail-soft write leaves the record ABSENT not stale. Assembly, not untangling — `profile_green` was already a separate verdict field.
- **The honesty is the product.** The Qualification Report's third section ("not proven") is the load-bearing one: skipped gates by id+reason, unchecked `acceptance[]`, pre-existing debt (`total - in_diff`), missing/unreadable evidence, the standing analyzer-toolchain residual. A short section 3 means the report has not looked. H1-H9 invariants, each with a test.
- **Three plan-level defects were caught by the implementing subagents BEFORE the critic** — exactly what independent execution is for: the circuit-breaker exit sat BEFORE the `try`, so quarantine-by-attempts would have written no evidence at all; `findings` in the record was already diff-filtered, so `total - in_diff` was zero by construction and the debt invisible; a parked run's report froze forever saying "escalated".
- **Four codex `gpt-5.6-luna` review rounds: 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> SAFE.** Every finding verified against real code; none false. R1: skipped gates lost, one success_command suppressed all acceptance, empty selection named a profile, fail-soft left a lying record. R2: schema accepted an impossible finding count (negative debt vanished), the F5 residual (double FS failure), a dedup-key collision. R3: schema accepted a commit hash on a non-committed record (forged product proof), a stale line's vocabulary split its rollup, a stale line kept untrusted `attempts`. **One R3 finding DECLINED with verified rationale:** the critic wanted live-queue reconciliation in the Qualification Report; declined because that report is about COMMITS not tasks (it reconciles against `git rev-list`, and `committed` is terminal), so threading task-location in would be a category error — R4 agreed the decline holds.
- **The deepest fix was Principle 11 made mechanical:** the F5 residual (both the pre-work clear and the post-work write fail on one iteration) cannot be closed by any file-only scheme. The Execution Report now reconciles each record against the LIVE blackboard queue; on a contradiction the queue wins, the record's detail is dropped, the line is flagged `evidence_stale`. The blackboard is the single source of truth; `evidence.json` is a projection that may never override it.
- **Live-proven, the two numbers appeared AND differed** (the whole point). A compliant new method on a legacy file committed green (`0590e9f`); its evidence records `phpcs` **green, exit_code 2, findings {total: 10, in_diff: 0}** — green on the added lines while the file carries 10 pre-existing findings. The Qualification Report lists phpcs under "proven on change" (section 1) AND the same file's 10 findings as debt (section 3), plus the 3 acceptance criteria as unchecked and every pre-ledger task as missing-evidence. The Execution Report for a pre-ledger run honestly reports "Evidence: 0 of 1 recorded — 1 absent" (H1).

## s51d (2026-07-22) — LINE-SCOPED PROFILE GATES MERGED — PR #84 (`c1ff87e`, CI 4/4), CLEAN at critic round 10

Fourth and final block of s51, on the operator's instruction ("gate feedback first, then we discuss scoping"). Closes the last limitation the Profiles live proof exposed.

- **The decision, taken with the operator:** the worker is responsible for the LINES IT WROTE, not the file it touched. Findings are filtered to the diff's added lines; the parse format is Checkstyle XML only (one parser, widest tool reach); out-of-diff debt is not shown to the worker (it would dilute a feedback channel the worker is required to act on).
- **A baseline file was rejected on principle, not taste.** A baseline IS an oracle: a worker able to regenerate it whitewashes all debt in one commit -- exactly what Principle 14 and `adr/006` exist to stop. We would have reopened by hand the hole three sessions had just closed. Line-scoping adds no artifact at all.
- **Ten codex `gpt-5.6-luna` rounds, 38 findings, CLEAN at round 10.** By far the longest convergence on this contour (Phase 1 took four, Phase 2 six). Roughly a third were fail-OPEN -- a finding the worker actually wrote could be dropped, or an invalid report could read as clean. The recurring shape, appearing in five separate rounds, was *validated one string, used another*: a case-insensitive containment check followed by an exact-case map lookup; then the same thing one key space over, in `newFiles`; and a probe that stat'd a path different from the one the runner received.
- **Two of my own fixes created the opposite error and had to be corrected again.** Round 3 made a case-insensitive lookup UNION the colliding keys' line sets, curing under-attribution and introducing over-attribution; round 4 settled it -- an ambiguous path is neither picked nor unioned but flagged `unattributed`, kept so nothing is lost and pinned to no file so nothing is falsely attributed. Round 5's unclosed-`<file>` guard then REJECTED valid reports (a self-closing `<file/>` is a clean file), and round 7's comment/CDATA counters rejected valid XML in one direction while passing malformed XML in the other -- fixed by replacing counting with a state machine that knows which construct is open.
- **One assumption was disproven by measurement, not argument.** The walker accepted a bare empty line as a blank context line, on an inherited comment claiming "some producers emit one". Capturing a real `git diff` over a file with a blank line showed git writes `" "`. The allowance protected nothing and let a corrupt hunk close with an empty added-set; both tests pinning it were rewritten around the verified behaviour.
- **Two critic findings were DECLINED with verified rationale** (a global-cap check the critic could not see because my own brief pasted half a file -- my error, fixed for later rounds; and an undeclared XML entity, which is text, cannot conceal an `<error>`, and whose only real effect routes to the blocking `unattributed` path). Round 10 explicitly agreed with the second on the merits.
- **Round 10 did more than fail to find defects:** it traced a multi-hunk diff line by line and confirmed no off-by-one in attribution, verified the three modules' contracts compose, and found no valid PHPCS output that any of the accumulated guards rejects.
- **Live-proven twice** -- once when built, and again on the FINAL code after six further rounds of rewriting, rather than trusting the earlier proof: a compliant change to a legacy file carrying 10 pre-existing violations commits green (`50385f2`), and a non-compliant one reports ONLY the worker's own lines (155-157) with the file's line-1 violations verifiably absent.
- **Result:** 1540 tests green, typecheck clean, `wordpress-woocommerce@2` shipped. Both limitations the Profiles v1 proof exposed are now closed.

## s51c (2026-07-22) — LINE-SCOPED PROFILE GATES: the worker owns the lines it wrote, not the file it touched

Third block of s51, on the operator's instruction ("gate feedback first, then we discuss scoping"). Closes the second and last limitation the Profiles live proof exposed.

- **The problem, measured before designing anything.** Profile gates scoped to changed FILES, so a task touching an existing file inherited that file's entire pre-existing debt: 7069 WPCS errors tree-wide versus 8 on the changed file, and 0 of 4 polygon PHP files clean. File-level scoping had made the gate *meaningful*; it had not made it *usable*.
- **The question, put to the operator as a product decision:** is the worker responsible for the file it touched, or the lines it wrote? He chose the lines. Three follow-ups settled the rest: Checkstyle XML as the single parse format (PHPCS/PHPStan/ESLint/Psalm all emit it — one parser, least guessing), and out-of-diff debt is NOT reported to the worker (we had just built a feedback channel it is required to act on; mixing in non-actionable text dilutes it, and unscoped cleanup fights anti-drift).
- **A baseline file was rejected on principle, not taste.** A baseline *is* an oracle: a worker able to regenerate it could whitewash every violation in one commit — precisely the reward-hacking Principle 14 and `adr/006` exist to stop. We would have re-opened, by hand, the hole three sessions had just closed. Line-scoping introduces no new artifact at all.
- **The build:** four pure modules and one wiring change. `diff-lines` maps a unified diff to the line numbers it ADDED (and, after review, to which files are new, from the `--- /dev/null` signal); `checkstyle` parses the machine report; `finding-filter` decides what the worker owns; `gate-feedback` renders the survivors as `path:line message [source]` — the worker never sees the machine format. The ordering in `runGate` is safety-critical and commented as such: **classify the exit code FIRST, parse only when the outcome is RED**, because a tool that failed to start emits empty output, and an empty report parses to zero findings, which downstream means CLEAN.
- **The parser was pinned on a REAL captured PHPCS report before a line of it was written.** That artifact immediately showed three things a hand-written fixture would have missed: absolute paths with backslashes, XML-escaped messages, and `warning` as well as `error` severities. This is the `agent-ci-ndjson-keyed-by-event-not-type` discipline applied prospectively instead of after the fact.
- **All three live directions proven** on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`: (1) a **compliant** change to a legacy file carrying **10** pre-existing violations → gate **green**, committed `44bb027` — impossible under v1, and the whole point; (2) a **non-compliant** addition to that same file → red, with the document listing **only** lines 146–148 and the file's own line-1 `InvalidClassFileName`/`InvalidEOLChar` verifiably ABSENT; (3) a brand-new non-compliant file → line-1 findings correctly INCLUDED, since every line of a new file is added.
- **One codex `gpt-5.6-luna` round, eight findings, three of them fail-open** — the dangerous direction: a finding the worker actually WROTE could be dropped. An added line whose text begins with `++` renders as `+++ text` and was mistaken for a file header (root cause: the walker guessed at prefixes instead of parsing the hunk's line counts — the module's own comment had argued FOR that shortcut); an unrecognized `@@` header left the cursor stale, giving WRONG line numbers, which is worse than none; a truncated report parsed to zero findings, i.e. "clean"; `line="abc"` became file-level and was then dropped; a `..`-escaping path passed the prefix check and was dropped rather than flagged. Plus Windows case-sensitivity causing false failures, the new-file heuristic replaced by the real signal, and numeric XML entities.
- **One finding declined, and the fault was mine:** "the omission footer is appended without a size check" — it is measured as part of the candidate document. The critic could not see that because my brief pasted only the rendering half of the file. Round 2's brief demanded complete files.
- **Re-proven after the fixes** rather than trusting the earlier run: the walker had been rewritten around hunk counts, so direction 2 was repeated end to end — identical behaviour, only the worker's own lines reported.
- **Result:** 1474 tests green, typecheck clean, `wordpress-woocommerce@2` shipped (a version bump, not ceremony: the same diff v1 rejected can now commit).

## s51b (2026-07-22) — GATE FEEDBACK ON RETRY: the worker now learns WHY the gate rejected it — PR #83 MERGED (`4745a9a`, CI 4/4)

Continuation of s51, on the operator's instruction ("gate feedback first, then we discuss scoping"). This closes the first of the two limitations the Profiles live proof exposed.

- **The gap.** `conductor.ts`'s RETRY branch moved the task back to pending and wrote nothing; `critic-feedback.md` is produced only on the critic/escalation paths; and every gate step discarded its subprocess output, keeping only the exit code. So the worker re-ran with identical context, reproduced the same diff, and burned its attempt budget before escalating. An exit code is not feedback — the linter's report is. Fail-safe, never fail-open, which is why v1 of Profiles shipped with it named rather than blocked on it.
- **The change, in three seams.** Each step's runner returns its combined stdout+stderr; `runGate` formats every failing step into one bounded document (`src/gate/gate-feedback.ts`) and persists it through an injected `writeGateFeedback` dep; the conductor reads it at claim time beside `critic-feedback.md` and the worker renders it as a **fenced** section. Scope covers all three output-producing steps (`checkCommand`, `success_commands`, profile gates) — fixing only the profile third would have been the half-applied fix this repo's critic keeps catching.
- **The design decision that carries the weight:** `writeGateFeedback` is called **exactly once per gate run, at the decisive exit** — the document when the run had failures, `null` (a real file DELETE) when it did not. That is what makes the artifact always mean "what the most recent gate run found", so it cannot go stale the way a per-round "latest value" write does (`gotchas/per-round-overwrite-artifact-stale.md`). Persisting from the conductor's RETRY branch was rejected: only `runGate` knows which steps failed, and routing the output through `GateVerdict` would have bloated `gate-verdict.json` with linter noise.
- **Live-proven end to end**, which is the whole point: round 1, a new PHP file drew `Missing file doc comment` + `Missing doc comment for class` → RETRY with the real PHPCS report persisted; round 2, the worker added exactly those two docblocks → gate green → **committed `c0fb8de`** — and `gate-feedback.md` was **gone**, the clean run having cleared it. A task that would previously have exhausted its budget converged in ONE retry.
- **What only the live run could find:** the first real artifact was full of ANSI colour escapes (PHPCS honours its ruleset's `colors` arg with no terminal), so the worker's prompt carried `ESC[31mERROR ESC[0m`. Stripped centrally in the formatter rather than by per-tool no-colour flags — a gate is an arbitrary operator command, and any future profile that forgot the flag would degrade silently. Stripped BEFORE clamping, so invisible bytes cannot eat the character budget.
- **Two codex `gpt-5.6-luna` rounds.** R1 found five: a gate THROW left stale feedback behind (the write ran only at the normal exit, and `runGate` throws from many places) · a red agent-ci never reached `failedSteps`, so when it was the ONLY failure the document was DELETED and the worker got a RETRY with no explanation · no GLOBAL document bound (per-step clamping left the step count and the labels unbounded) · tool output containing ``` closed the document's own fence · `clampOutput` went negative below limit 40 and could exceed its own limit. R2 cleared the lifecycle (try/finally reachability and the staleness question both clean) and found three narrower instances inside those fixes: the cap ignored `join`'s separators and the unmeasured footer · the omission marker's width grows with its digit count, so a fixed 40-char reserve ran over · emptiness was judged before stripping, so pure-ANSI output rendered an empty code block.
- **One critic finding was FALSE and verified as such:** `stripAnsi`'s regex was reported as having no ESC handling at all. It did — the tests prove it — but the source held a *raw ESC byte*, which does not survive being pasted into a prompt. Behaviour was correct; the source was nonetheless changed to `` so it says what it means in plain ASCII. Same transport class as `gotchas/codex-inline-diff-strips-quotes-false-blocker.md`.
- **Re-verified after the critic fixes** rather than trusting the earlier proof: the second live run happened to pass first try (the worker copied the now-committed clean file's style), which proves the clear path but not the write path, so the post-fix formatter was fed a **real captured PHPCS report** — ESC present in the raw bytes, absent in the rendered document, output readable and bounded.
- **Result:** 1407 tests green, typecheck clean. GOTCHAS: `[conductor/gate-retry-carries-no-feedback]` marked RESOLVED.

## s51 (2026-07-22) — PROFILES v1 SHIPPED: the WP/WC Qualification Layer + `adr/006` Phase 3 — 6 codex-luna rounds, all three live directions proven — PR #82 MERGED (`ee0be38`, CI 4/4)

Unattended build session (operator granted full autonomy before sleeping, including the standing merge grant and permission to run the live proof). Brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent-driven build, per the repo contract.

- **The design fork, decided with the operator before he left.** Six questions, six answers: the first consumer is the test polygon (prove the mechanism, not a commercial plugin); a profile is an **oracle source, not a second judge**; it lives in the **harness** repo (trust by construction); only the two *mechanically provable* facets ship (`gates` + `protectedPaths` — `critic-rubrics` and `north-star` are LLM judgement and would have been theater on an honest foundation); profile and project config **union with no selective disable** (a profile with gates plucked out is not that profile, and "qualified by `<id>@<version>`" would stop meaning anything); the v1 gate set is static (`composer validate` + PHPCS/WPCS) because that is what is actually executable on the Windows polygon.
- **Why "oracle source, not second judge" was the load-bearing call.** It is the reason the entire `adr/006` Phase 1+2 protection is inherited unchanged rather than rebuilt: the profile's `protectedPaths` are simply a fifth source in `resolveOracleSet`, and its gates are a new step 1d beside `agentCi`'s 1c. **`adr/006` Phase 3 therefore landed here**, exactly as the ADR predicted it would.
- **Measurement killed two parts of my own design before a line of the profile was written.** Running the ruleset against the real plugin first: **7069** errors tree-wide vs **8** on the file a task actually changes. A whole-tree gate is red on every run regardless of the diff — it blocks everything and proves nothing — so gates became **diff-scoped** (`files:` glob + a `{files}` placeholder expanded per task). And PHPStan was dropped from v1 on a technical, not a modest, reason: WordPress analysis needs an extension living in the *project's* vendor, which a profile-shipped neon cannot portably reference, and without it a correct file draws 14 phantom findings — a false-red machine.
- **Five codex `gpt-5.6-luna` rounds, the same convergence shape as Phase 1's four and Phase 2's six** — each round finding a narrower instance inside the previous round's own fix. R1: RED and UNRUNNABLE exits conflated (any non-zero read as worker-fixable, so a tool that ran but could not do its job looped the worker forever); R2: the fix still admitted `={profile}/...`, because "ends with `=`" is not proof of a flag; R3: `<dir>/../outside.xml` still escaped and `<dir>-evil/x` passed as a bare path; R4: the module's whole trust claim ("it lives in the harness repo") was **asserted but never verified** — a symlinked profile directory made the containment check vacuous; R5: an absolute path hiding after a *second* `=` (`--define=KEY=C:\outside`). Two findings declined with rationale verified against real code (the fifth oracle source does NOT lack cross-platform absolute detection — it goes through `addLiteral`/`addGlob`, which already call `isAbsoluteOnAnyPlatform`; and `prepareGateInvocation` should not re-validate an invariant `loadProfile` already enforces at the entry point).
- **Exit codes were measured, not assumed.** `composer validate` exits 3 with no manifest and 1 on a schema violation; PHPCS 1/2 are findings and 3 is a processing error. Gates now declare `redExitCodes`; anything undeclared and non-zero is "the tool could not do its job" → throw → escalate, never a RETRY the worker cannot act on.
- **All three live directions proven** on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`: (1) a new PHP file drew two *genuine* WPCS errors (class-file-name and CRLF) → `profile_green:false` → RETRY; (2) a docs task → phpcs correctly **skipped** and logged → `profile_green:true` → **committed** `35db1a4`; (3) a task whose `file_set` held `phpcs.xml` → `constitution` escalation naming the profile as the source, raised **before the critic** — no `critic-verdict.json` written at all.
- **Two honest limitations the live run exposed, both now the top NEXT ACTIONS.** Diff-scoping is per FILE, not per LINE, so a task touching an existing file inherits its whole pre-existing debt — and every PHP file in the polygon is already non-zero, so v1 is practically green only for new files. And a red gate gives the worker **no feedback at all**: the RETRY branch writes no artifact, `critic-feedback.md` is written only on critic/escalation paths, and the tool's stdout is discarded — so the worker reproduces the same diff until its budget runs out. Fail-safe, not fail-open (nothing wrong merges; the task parks), pre-existing for `checkCommand`, but load-bearing for profiles. GOTCHAS 73 → 75.
- **Process note, recorded rather than hidden:** the diff-scoping redesign was written before its tests (TDD violated by me, not by the implementer subagents). Corrected by extracting the decision into a pure `prepareGateInvocation` and pinning it with tests, then **mutation-checking** them — removing the skip and the whitespace refusal turned three tests red, so they are not vacuous.
- **R6 and the merge.** The sixth round found the R5 version fix guarded only the REFERENCE side, not the YAML side -- the half-applied-fix pattern one more time. Its HIGH was downgraded after a test proved the described round trip unreachable (it needs a reference pinning 2^53, which R5 already refuses); the guard was still added, because without it the failure surfaces as a version-mismatch message pointing at the wrong problem. R6 also cleared the end-to-end trace: no path where a gate silently does not run, a result never reaches the verdict, or a failure reads as a pass. CI initially failed on Linux -- my own dist-parity test needs a build, and CI ran `npm test` before `npm run build`; fixed by reordering CI, not by softening the test, since tolerating a missing dist/ would delete the test's whole purpose.
- **Result:** 1358 tests green, typecheck clean, profile verified loading from the compiled `dist/` build (the test that exists specifically to defeat the `critic-schema-json-not-copied-to-dist` failure mode).

## s50 (2026-07-22) — `adr/006` PHASE 2 SHIPPED: executable-input protected paths — 6 codex-luna rounds to CLEAN, live-proven both directions — PR #79 MERGED (`44aebd8`, CI 4/4) + docs audit PR #81 MERGED (`0a89a45`, CI 4/4)

Attended build session. Operator ordered the session explicitly: close the `adr/006` tail first, then the docs audit, then Profiles if context allows. Started by offering the s50 docs-audit checkpoint (session divisible by 10) — deferred behind the enforcement work by operator choice.
- **The gap Phase 2 closes.** Phase 1 (s49) stopped a worker changing *what the gate checks* by reading oracle **definitions** from the trusted root. It explicitly left the *contents of executable oracle inputs* open — guard **test files** the mutation-check runs, agent-ci **workflow implementations**, mutation **recipes**, and operator-declared human-only paths, all executed from the worktree and worker-writable whenever the orchestrator put them in `file_set`. Nothing required `forbidden_paths` (LLM-authored, best-effort) to cover them, and both the porcelain fence and the gate's constitution check are **git-visible only**, so a target-repo-gitignored oracle file could be rewritten with no trace at all.
- **The change.** New `src/gate/oracle-paths.ts`: `resolveOracleSet(cfg, raw, repoRoot)` derives the protected set from the **trusted root** — `contract.invariantsFile`/`guardsFile`, **every** GUARDS.md row's `recipe` + `guard_test` (all rows, not only mutation-verified: an unverified row's test file is still an oracle input), `gate.agentCi.workflows` + `.github/workflows/**` when agent-ci is enabled, and `contract.constitutionPaths`. `recipe.file` is deliberately NOT protected — it is the code under test, and protecting it would make every guarded zone's own source unwritable. The conductor takes a fingerprint baseline before the worker and fences after, **ahead of the critic** (an oracle touch now burns no critic tokens) and **ahead of the stray/forbidden fence** (so the reason is "the worker edited the oracle", not a generic "out of scope"). Reuses the existing `constitution` escalation type — already non-retryable in the overnight supervisor, so zero new plumbing.
- **Two arms, deliberately unequal, not conflated.** `literals` are fingerprinted directly on disk — that is what covers a **git-ignored** oracle file (audit SOUND #3 scope), and every *derived* entry is a literal, so the concrete hole is closed. `globs` match the git-visible touched set only; a gitignored path matching *only* an operator glob stays a documented residual (needs a bounded, junction-safe worktree walk).
- **Six luna rounds, each a narrower leak inside the previous round's own FIX** — the s46/s49 pattern, longer. R1: absolute entries passed trusted-root containment but `join` concatenates an absolute 2nd arg where `resolve` discards it → `<absent>`/`<absent>`, silently unprotected; globs had no containment check at all. R2: the fix wrapped `lstat`+`realpathContains` in ONE try/catch re-thrown by **message prefix** → a containment fs-error read as "not created yet"; and `path.isAbsolute` is the HOST impl, so Windows forms pass as relative on POSIX (this is a cross-platform product). R3: a bare `catch` on `lstat` folded EACCES/ELOOP into "absent"; an entry resolving to the repo root normalized to `""`, which `snapshot` **skips outright**; `\foo` escaped the hand-rolled regexes. R4: `resolveTrustedFile` still had the bare catch; `\`-separated literals mis-probed on POSIX (`resolve` treats `\` as a filename byte); a **symlinked leaf** was accepted although `snapshot` follows it and hashes the target. R5: separator folding applied to only one of the two probe paths. R6: **CLEAN** on security/enforcement, one minor hardening (FIFO/socket/device) applied. One invariant took five rounds to state properly: *every entry is worktree-relative, `/`-separated, and names a real regular file*. **One codex finding was DECLINED with verification** — it claimed backslash globs could never match, but `globMatch` folds `\`→`/` on both sides (glob.ts:10-11), so it was not a live hole; normalized anyway for set consistency, labelled hygiene rather than a fix.
- **Live-proven both directions** on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`, real worker, real repo: a task whose `file_set` held `.github/workflows/ci.yml` escalated `constitution` with the oracle evidence and **never reached the critic** (runtime dir has `worker-report.md` but no `critic-verdict.json`/`diff.patch`); a control task on a non-oracle file passed the fence, the critic AND the gate and **committed** (`dd79ef4`). The live run also caught a defect the unit tests structurally could not: a file matched by BOTH arms produced two evidence lines and "modified **2** oracle artifact(s)" for one edit, one path missing its leading dot (`normalizePath`) — fixed by `mergeOracleHits` + a regression test, then re-proven live. Overstating one edit as two is exactly the unearned claim Principle 13 forbids in our own artifacts.
- **Numbers.** 1177→1251 tests green (37 in the new module, 6+1 in the conductor), typecheck clean, both bundles rebuilt. GOTCHAS 72→73 (`[gate/oracle-protected-paths-relative-invariant]`).
- **Named, not hidden:** `success_command`/`checkCommand` *implementations* are commands, not declared paths, so they are protected only if the operator lists them in `constitutionPaths`. Deriving a path set from a command string is not reliably decidable — recorded as an open question rather than papered over.
- **Docs audit (the divisible-by-10 checkpoint), run after Phase 2 on its own branch.** Mechanical pass was clean: gotcha index 73/73 with no orphans or dead links, every `## Related` present, all `file:line` citations in range, every `npm run` cited in docs exists. Eleven content findings fixed. Two `high`: `adr/README.md` still listed **ADR-003 as "proposed"** though it was accepted at s10 sign-off; and `AGENT-RULES.md` stated "Squash-merge on green CI" unconditionally, which **contradicted the merge policy s49 had just reconciled in `AGENTS.md`** — green CI is a precondition, not a trigger (attended waits for the operator's word). Fixed by pointing AGENT-RULES at AGENTS.md rather than restating the condition, so they cannot drift apart a third time. Medium: DOCS-INDEX said the s48 audit found "4 holes" (it found 5 — Finding 5, fail-open-on-missing-oracle, is exactly what Phase 1's fail-closed behaviour exists to close); FUTURE-BACKLOG still listed **Aider as "not yet analyzed — analyze next"** although `adr/002`/VISION accepted it as the fourth settled donor and `donor-extraction/aider-brief.md` exists. One finding was flagged UNRESOLVED (is `PRINCIPLES.md` an every-session read?) and **decided rather than deferred**: s49/s50 practice already treated it as one, so it is now step 2 of the Session Start Protocol. Low: dropped the `[fork/*]`/`[electron/*]` tag namespaces (both anticipated under the abandoned `adr/001` fork plan), re-banner'd `reference/ao-codex-critic-protocol.md` as HISTORICAL (its critic *policy* is what we ported; its AO mechanics were never built), removed 4 blank lines that were **splitting the GOTCHAS table into fragments no renderer shows as one table**, added a narrow AGENTS.md carve-out for verbatim operator quotes in the original language, and put `superpowers/` into the navigation table it was missing from despite being linked by three ADRs. Finally, **this file's sibling was violating its own schema**: `CURRENT-STATE.md` had accumulated three "What sXX delivered" blocks (s48/s49/s50) where the schema says the previous session's block is *replaced* — trimmed to s50 only, 204→156 lines, with "Recent sessions" reduced to genuine one-liners.

## s49 (2026-07-21) — `adr/006` PHASE 1 SHIPPED: oracle definition integrity — 4 codex-luna rounds, live-proven end-to-end — PR #78 MERGED (`cc0db6f`, CI 4/4)

Attended build session. Operator chose Track B (the narrow enforcement fix) before Track A (Profiles), and approved reconciling the merge-policy doc contradiction. Started by pushing s48's two unpushed docs commits and closing an open question: PR #76 (s45) was already MERGED (17.07).
- **The change.** `gateDeps` now binds `loadInvariants`/`loadGuardPairs` — and `guardStillRed`'s guard-pair **selection** — to `repoRoot`, the trusted root the worker never writes; check command / success commands / agent-ci / the mutation *run* stay against `wt.path`. The gate is finally symmetric with `zonesTouchedInDiff`. **Fail-closed:** a contract file explicitly configured in the RAW yaml but absent / escaping the root / behind a symlink throws → escalate; not-configured + absent stays legitimate (needs `isContractFileConfigured` on the pre-defaults raw object — zod defaults both keys, so parsed `cfg` cannot tell the two apart). **`contract.constitutionPaths` wired** into the gate's constitution check (unioned + deduped) — dead config since the schema shipped.
- **Four luna rounds, each finding a narrower leak in the previous fix** (the s46 pattern again). R1: "read from repoRoot" is not a guarantee — `join` clamps neither `..` nor an intermediate symlinked ancestor; and fail-closed alone would brick every already-scaffolded project (the scaffold always configured `guardsFile` and never wrote it). R2: the migration fix healed `INVARIANTS.md` too — an empty invariants file is a **vacuous pass**, converting fail-closed into fail-open (guards-only heal is the correct asymmetry: missing guards → uncovered zone → escalate). R3: the new stub-**write** path re-used the same lexical containment the read path had just abandoned; plus Windows case-sensitivity + single-trailing-separator bugs in the shared helper. R4: the migration *asserted* its target was git-ignored without verifying it — a tracked `stateDir` would dirty the tree and block every merge (`[env/serena-churn-blocks-merge]` class) → now verified via `git check-ignore`. Declined: TOCTOU-on-read (needs an actor that mutates the trusted root; documented accepted residual, same as the static-server realpath→open one) and "healing is laxer than the broken-config state" (the blanket escalation was breakage, not a guarantee).
- **New module** `src/util/path-contain.ts` — realpath containment shared by the oracle read path and the stub-write path; lives in `util/` because `registry/` importing `composition/` is the wrong direction. 1207 tests green (from 1177), typecheck clean.
- **Live-proof (operator-observable, real repo).** Daemon start self-healed the real test project's missing `.autodev/GUARDS.md` (INFO log). Then a contract zone `shipping-method-ids` declared **only** at the trusted root (`.autodev/INVARIANTS.md`, git-excluded → physically absent from any worktree) escalated a real docblock task: `decision: ESCALATE`, `zone 'shipping-method-ids' touched (path/grep, no enumerated value) but no mutation-verified guard covers it`. Pre-Phase-1 that identical run read `EMPTY_INVARIANTS` and would have committed vacuously — audit Finding 3, closed and demonstrated. (First attempt escalated `blocked` instead: my intent named a method that does not exist and the worker correctly refused to invent a target — re-run with a real method.)
- **Docs.** `adr/006` Phase-1 marked shipped with what the plan did not anticipate; new gotcha `[gate/oracle-definitions-trusted-root]` (GOTCHAS 71→72) covering the three behaviour surprises + the migration asymmetry; `AGENTS.md` merge policy reconciled — attended = the operator's merge word, unattended/overnight = the standing auto-merge grant.

## s48 (2026-07-21) — AUTHORITY MODEL AUDIT + `adr/006` (capability-based) + `PRINCIPLES.md` +2 — docs only (operator-scoped narrow), codex-luna-reviewed — MERGED to `main` (`c6c2343`)

Attended, docs-only session. The next-session prompt scoped s48 to the external review's sharpest finding (risk 5, "the worker must never control its own oracle"): audit → `adr/006` → PRINCIPLES hardening → fix enforcement ONLY if a real hole. Operator delegated the priority + chose "docs only" when the audit found real holes (fix spun into its own gated task).
- **Audit (`wiki/authority-model-audit-2026-07.md`), evidence-based with file:line.** Traced worker → fence → critic → gate. **Sound (5):** the task contract (`file_set`/`forbidden_paths`/`success_commands`) and gate config live in git-excluded `.autodev` (read from main root) → the worker structurally cannot rewrite its own spec or re-point the gate; the dirty-file fence bounds writes to `file_set`; `zonesTouchedInDiff` routing reads main-root INVARIANTS; orchestrator R1 intact. **Holes (5):** (1) `gateDeps(wt)` reads every oracle input from the **worktree** (`root.ts:299-441`) — INVARIANTS/GUARDS tamperable if in `file_set`; (2) `contract.constitutionPaths` is dead config (grep: zero enforcement uses); (3) scaffold points `contract.invariantsFile` at git-excluded `.autodev/INVARIANTS.md` → absent from worktree → `EMPTY_INVARIANTS` → gate zone/constitution checks silently VACUOUS (verified live on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`: `git check-ignore` + untracked); (4) no capability/protected-paths model; (5) missing oracle fails OPEN (contra Principle 10).
- **`adr/006` — capability-based Authority Model.** Rights by capability, not role: oracle **definitions** from a trusted root, **execution** against the worktree, **modifications** via operator bless. Phased enforcement (NOT built s48): Phase-1 definition integrity (incl. `guardStillRed`'s own reload + fail-closed on unreadable), Phase-2 executable-input protected-paths (tests/scripts/workflow impls + ignored paths), Phase-3 profiles (must themselves be trusted-root, else self-authorizing).
- **`PRINCIPLES.md` +2** (13→15): #14 "the worker does not write its own oracle" (write-authority, distinct from #2's no-self-certify), #15 "the gate proves only formalized properties" (review risk 3, the corollary that drives Profiles).
- **codex `gpt-5.6-luna` adversarial review** (fed inline code excerpts, read-only) — all findings valid, no false blockers: overstated CI claim (allowlist is trusted, only workflow *impl* executes from worktree), scoped the "sound" framing (trusted-root **definition** reads do NOT protect executed **test/script contents** — that's Phase-2), flagged `guardStillRed`'s direct `loadGuardPairsFrom(wt.path)` bypass, fail-open oracle, and the fence's git-visible-only scope. All folded into both docs with a `codex-flagged` trail.
- **Docs wiring:** new gotcha `[gate/oracle-read-from-worktree]` (GOTCHAS 70→71); DOCS-INDEX + `adr/README.md` index (added 004/005/006). Open (carried): s45 PR status; merge-policy reconciliation. Merged to `main` in-turn (`c6c2343`); branch deleted.

## s47 (2026-07-21) — DOCS CONSOLIDATION + external-agent feedback processed → Authority-Model→Profiles thrust defined — MERGED to `main` (`7759346`, docs-only)

Discussion-first session (no product code). Operator flagged two topics: docs cleanup, and feedback on the project from another agent (GPT, which had studied the repo).
- **Docs cleanup (shipped, commit `5538715`).** Diagnosed two drifts: (A) `CURRENT-STATE.md` had grown into a second SESSION-LOG (139 KB); (B) the foundational docs (README, CLAUDE.md, VISION body, AGENT-RULES) still told the superseded "fork AO / Go daemon / Electron / day-zero" story (ADR-002/003 killed it 2026-07-01 but the anchors were only banner-patched). AGENT-RULES had the single-source-of-truth rule **inverted** ("AO's session/PR model authoritative") → corrected to the file-blackboard. Fixed all foundation docs to the real state (own Node+TS build, blackboard = truth, roles matrix, critic gpt-5.6-luna). Slimmed CURRENT-STATE 139 KB→~8 KB (snapshot + replace-not-append discipline recorded in DOCS-SCHEMA).
- **New `docs/PRINCIPLES.md`** — the constitution (13 invariants, each Principle→Why→Enforced-by tied to a real incident), per the external review's advice (it independently suggested a `philosophy.md`/`architecture-principles.md`). Wired into DOCS-INDEX (read-first) + DOCS-SCHEMA.
- **External review processed** → saved as `wiki/architecture-review-external-2026-07.md` (English summary + our disposition per point; provenance attributed). Made `wiki/`'s role explicit (Architecture Notes — rationale, not API) instead of creating a competing `docs/architecture/` folder (that would re-introduce the very multi-source drift we just cured). Second docs commit for these touches + session wrap.
- **The strategic output:** the review's sharpest points (risk 5 "worker must never control its own oracle"; risk 7 "Plugin Factory needs a Qualification Layer") synthesize into a thrust — **Authority Model → Profiles/Qualification Layer → two reports (Run vs Product) → Evaluation Corpus** — order load-bearing. This is the "profiles" idea the operator liked, reframed: a profile proves the *product*, not helps the worker write it, and is meaningful only if the oracle is outside worker authority.
- **Priority call (operator delegated it):** s48 = **Authority Model, scoped narrow** (audit worker write-authority over oracle artifacts + `adr/006` + PRINCIPLES hardening); s49+ = Profiles/WP-WC Qualification Layer (north-star from adr/004 likely folds in); remaining adr/004 slices (morning report, anti-drift) after/interleaved. Not over-pivoting — one line, by priority.
- **NEXT (s48):** the Authority-Model audit + `adr/006`. Open: s45 PR status (`autodev/s45-carried-items`); merge-policy reconciliation (AGENTS.md standing-grant vs in-turn practice). The s47 docs branch was merged to `main` in-turn (`7759346`).

## s46 (2026-07-20) — overnight PRESENCE TOGGLE (ADR-004 unattended half, 2nd slice): daemon wiring + global settings store + sidebar UI — 4-pass codex(luna)-gated + LIVE-PROVEN (real daemon + Chrome) — branch `autodev/s46-overnight-presence-toggle` (PR pending)

Attended. Operator chose (4 one-at-a-time picks): full slice (daemon + store + UI) · global master AND per-project opt-in, runs on the AND · plain persistent boolean · sidebar-footer placement (a knowing, documented divergence from ADR-004's literal "top-bar").
- **The discovery that justified the slice:** s45's `superviseOvernight` was **unreachable from the daemon** — `runOrSupervise` had exactly one caller (CLI `run`, `index.ts`), while BOTH daemon run paths (`root.ts` `trigger`, `index.ts` reply-B drain) called `conductor.run` directly. s45's headless CLI live-proves never surfaced it. This slice makes the supervisor reachable and toggle-gated.
- **Store + AND semantics:** daemon-global operator PRESENCE in `~/.autodev/settings.json` (`overnight.enabled`) — never-throws load (ENOENT→silent defaults, else defaults+ERROR), atomic tmp+rename save with an `lstat`/`rm`+`wx` symlink guard on BOTH the dest AND the tmp path, writes serialized through a promise chain. Per-project opt-in stays `autonomy.overnight.enabled` in the project `.autodev/config.yaml`. `shouldSupervise` = opt-in checked first (no IO in the attended case) × presence read **fresh per trigger** (read-through, no ProjectRoot cache); any presence-read failure → `false` (never fall INTO autonomy). `countOptedIn` reads each project's config directly for the intersection count.
- **UI (shadcn-first):** vendored the base-nova `switch`; sidebar-footer `OvernightToggle` with a three-state sub-line (`off · attended` / `on · N of M projects` / `on · no project opted in`, uncertain tone) + a collapsed-rail icon+tooltip variant; per-project opt-in `ToggleRow` in Project Settings' `AUTONOMY` section (send-only-changed diff); `GET`/`PATCH /settings` returning `{overnight, optedInProjects, totalProjects}`; `useUpdateProjectConfig` also invalidates `qk.settings`. The Task-7 worker caught a real bug my plan missed — opening `ScaffoldFormSchema`'s autonomy field alone would make PATCH return 200 while `mergeConfigYaml` silently dropped the value (the exact silent-no-op class this slice exists to kill) → added a `mergeConfigYaml` autonomy branch + round-trip test.
- **Gate — 1161 tests/3 skip (+42), typecheck + build(root+ui) green. codex gpt-5.6-luna 4 passes**, rounds 2–4 each finding a NARROWER leak in the previous round's FIX: NOT SAFE (tmp symlink hole + `trigger`'s `?? {once:true}` bounded-default guarding only `undefined`) → fixed → NOT SAFE (`{once:false,drain:false}` still unbounded via the key-count check; `rm recursive` could delete a dir — LOW) → `hasBound()` value allow-list + drop `recursive` → NOT SAFE (`typeof maxIterations === "number"` admits NaN/Infinity, for which conductor's `iterations >= maxIterations` never fires) → `Number.isFinite` → **SAFE**. Every fix re-critic'd, never self-certified. New gotcha `[conductor/once-precedes-drain]` (`once` short-circuits `drain` at conductor.ts:705<:719; a shape-guarded bounded default is not a bound) — GOTCHAS 69→70.
- **LIVE-PROVEN (real daemon `serve` + Chrome, operator-attended):** all three sub-line states driven live, each verified on disk (`settings.json` enabled; `config.yaml` autonomy block; API `optedInProjects` 0→1); collapsed-rail tooltip "Overnight: on · 1 of 1 projects". Then a **zero-LLM park contrast** through the REAL `run --max-iterations 1` path against a seeded non-retryable (`constitution`) escalation: presence OFF → `conductor.run` branch, decision-journal empty; presence ON → `superviseOvernight` branch, one `constitution → park` journal line. Only the toggle changed. The assembled daemon genuinely reads presence and routes. Test repo restored to baseline (git clean, presence OFF, opt-in removed, probe + journal deleted).
- **NEXT (s47):** open the s46 PR + merge (operator in-turn). Then the DOCS + new-project-goals discussion the operator flagged for "later". Remaining ADR-004 unattended half: morning report, north-star concept doc, mandatory anti-drift — each its own brainstorm→spec→plan.

## s45 (2026-07-17) — 2 carried fixes + shadcn-helpers recon + FIRST unattended-autonomy slice (overnight escalation handling) BUILT + 4-pass codex-gated + LIVE-PROVEN — branch `autodev/s45-carried-items` (16 commits, PR pending)

Attended session. Operator skipped the GitHub auto-merge setup (does not want `--auto`); chose "small items first, then the unattended-autonomy brainstorm."
- **Carried fix #1 — safeLog (`2c00ba7`)**: made `createApiServer`'s base `log` fail-closed file-wide (wrapper + module `safeErrorText` + 9 `String(err)`→`safeErrorText` swaps); a throwing logger no longer aborts a request (even the terminal error backstop). 3 TDD tests (red = 30s hang). codex(luna) APPROVE ×2 (fix + nit-fixes). Closes the s44 `[ts/fail-closed]` backlog.
- **Carried fix #2 — dotted-id SPA-fallback (`c873c82`)**: root fix for `[ui/dotted-id-breaks-spa-reload]` — SPA-fallback now serves index.html for any missing NON-`/assets/` path (regardless of dots), so run/task/thread ids with dots resolve on reload; `/assets/*` still 404s loudly (never mask a stale bundle). Security preserved (only ENOENT falls back; blocked excluded; containment before fallback), verified vs real source. codex(luna) APPROVE (0 findings).
- **shadcn AI-helpers recon (`d6c518b`)**: operator flagged `ui.shadcn.com/docs/helpers/{ai-sdk,tanstack-ai}`. Verdict: both are offline conversation TEST-fixtures gated on adopting a `useChat` runtime we don't have (our chat is custom SSE). Backlogged the real candidate — a **chat-runtime migration to TanStack AI + AG-UI** (stack-fit with our Router+Query; would also unlock deterministic chat tests) as its own future brainstorm.
- **Unattended-overnight-escalation-handling — FIRST slice of ADR-004's unattended half.** Full brainstorm → spec (`e02b68b`) → plan (`ccab416`) → subagent-driven build (Sonnet 5). An above-gate, deterministic (no-LLM) `superviseOvernight` loop-until-dry: reason-routes each escalation by `EscalationType` (retryable disagreement/uncertain/poison → auto-rework via the s42/s44 reply-B triple, bounded by `maxAutoReworks`; park constitution/needs-guard/blocked/dirty-file/drift), journaling every decision to `.autodev/decision-journal.ndjson`. Inert unless `autonomy.overnight.enabled`. Never touches the critic/gate/commit (tenet 6).
- **codex gpt-5.6-luna gate — 4 passes** (the discipline earning its keep): BLOCKED (4 Major) → fixed A/B/C/D → STILL BLOCKED (D partial: non-atomic budget) → requeue-as-commit fix → STILL BLOCKED (D: cross-run over-budget on persistent counter-write failure) → **saga fix** (persist-first + compensating rollback + in-memory `seen` tally) → **PASS WITH NITS** → nit (silent rollback catch) fixed. New gotcha `[autonomy/budget-saga-order]` (GOTCHAS 68→69) — a per-task budget spanning two blackboard files can't be atomic; order the saga to fail toward LESS spend.
- **Gate**: 1119 tests / 3 skip, typecheck + build (root+ui) green. **LIVE-PROVEN through the real daemon (twice)**: (1) zero-LLM park proof — seeded blocked + budget-exhausted disagreement → two correct `park` journal lines, both stayed escalated, zero worker runs (proves parseReworkCount fail-closed live + the full config→supervisor→parseEscalation→routing→journal wiring); (2) bounded auto-rework proof — seeded a disagreement docblock task → auto-rework journal line → worker (Sonnet) re-ran reading `critic-feedback.md` → critic (luna) clean → **real commit `d67674e`** (docblock landed). Test repo restored to baseline.
- **NEXT (s46)**: this batch is PR-ready (agent to open + operator approves merge in-turn per the classifier). Then the rest of ADR-004's unattended half (overnight top-bar toggle, morning report, north-star doc, mandatory anti-drift) — each its own brainstorm→spec→plan.

## s44 (2026-07-16) — gpt-5.6-luna PROMOTED as critic (calibrated) + reply-B poison-fix SHIPPED — codex-gated + LIVE-PROVEN end-to-end, branch `autodev/s44-gpt56-critic-and-poison-fix`

Autonomous overnight session. Operator present only for (b)'s decision, then granted full autonomy ("прогоняй полностью в том числе live-prove через браузер без меня, гоняй пока не убедишься"). Two deliverables; the brainstorm (#4) deliberately NOT started (next session).

**(b) — Evaluate gpt-5.6 as the critic → promoted `gpt-5.6-luna` (commit `66f322f`).** Built a faithful calibration harness: the EXACT production critic invocation (`codex exec -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort="high" ... --output-schema ... -o outfile -`) fed the real `buildCriticPrompt(diff)` from `dist/`, on 4 known cases reconstructed in the plugin style — method-id parse bug (broken), its explode(':') fix (clean, = the saved `dhl-express-cart-fee/diff.patch`), a correct getter no-test (clean, ADR-005), a load-order silent-skip (broken). **Validated the fixtures against the gpt-5.5 baseline first (4/4 known verdicts)** — a case-3 draft copied a wrong-text-domain string and sol correctly flagged it (broken 0.98); fixed to a bare-constant getter (smoke caught the confound). Then 3 rounds each of sol/terra/luna. **luna 12/12 correct** (matches 5.5, sharper confidence on the real bugs 0.9+, cheapest of the family) → promoted. **sol** deterministically false-blocks the correct fix (case2 broken 3/3, worst gate profile, most expensive). **terra** unreliably catches the real method-id bug (1× clean-MISS, 1× uncertain, only 1× broken over 3). Applied: `schema.ts` critic default `gpt-5.5`→`gpt-5.6-luna` (kills s43 un-pinned drift onto the sol CLI-default) + updated 2 default-asserting tests; `detect-agents.ts` catalog offers the three 5.6 variants for the UI picker. Docs: `wiki/critic-model-calibration-s44.md` (reusable methodology), gotcha `[critic/gpt-5.6-variant-behaviors]` (67→68), FUTURE-BACKLOG eval item closed.

**(a) — reply-B poison-fix (commit `07797c8`, resolves `[rework/reply-b-poisons-maxrounds-exhausted-task]`).** Root cause (conductor.ts:221): the `attempts` circuit-breaker counter increments per claim and poisons at `>maxAttempts`, and was never reset on reply-B — so reply-B on a round-exhausted escalation re-claimed → poison→quarantine in ~80ms, no worker. Fix (TDD): the `POST /escalations/:id/reply` choice-B branch calls `repo.setAttempts(id, 0)` after the successful escalated→pending move and BEFORE the `onReplyRework` drain, so the re-claim increments 0→1 (under budget) and reaches the worker. Scoped to choice B + a real move (never A/quarantine, never the ENOENT drift no-op); best-effort like the adjacent hook guard (a setAttempts failure never breaks the 200); the in-loop retry poison-pill unchanged. 2 unit tests (B resets to 0 / A leaves it) + 1 real repo+scheduler integration test (reply-B on an attempts=maxAttempts task re-claims fresh, not poisoned). **codex gpt-5.6-luna gate: 1 Medium (best-effort catch could re-throw if `String(err)`/`log` throws — `[ts/fail-closed]` class) DECLINED with rationale** (the file's convention across 10 catch sites; default `log` is a no-op; not a regression of this diff) + backlogged the file-wide `safeLog` refactor.

**Gate:** 1089 tests / 3 skip (+3), typecheck + build green (root+ui) on both commits.

**LIVE-PROVEN end-to-end through the REAL daemon + Chrome:** (1) **Deterministic (a) proof** — seeded an escalated task at `attempts=3` (= maxAttempts = the exact poison precondition) → API reply-B → **attempts 3→0** (server log `reply B -> moved escalated/ -> pending/`) → drain re-claimed → conductor claim `0+1=1` (NO poison, task went `active/` not `quarantine/`) → worker (sonnet) wrote a correct docblock reading the seeded critic-feedback → **luna `clean 0.98`** → gate agent-ci 5/5 green → **COMMIT `4fae4d2`** → DONE. The before/after contrast lives in ONE `conductor.log`: s43 pre-fix `[ESCALATE] pickup-cart-handling-fee (poison)` at 23:28:23 vs s44 worker-run provisioning at 01:05:37. (2) **Browser run** — a thread launched in Chrome (streaming pre-launch chat → proposed-plan preview → Launch → self-narrating run with instant activity cells + prose, no dead air) reached DONE with **luna `clean 0.99`** → agent-ci 5/5 → **COMMIT `e3073aa`**; the SESSION INSPECTOR ROLES row and the launch composer chip both read `codex · gpt-5.6-luna · high`, so (b) is confirmed live in the UI. Two real commits on the test repo's `autodev/main` (`4fae4d2`, `e3073aa`), tree clean, queue = 4 done, nothing stranded.

**NEXT (s45):** merge the s44 PR on green CI (autonomous). Then operator picks the UNATTENDED-HALF AUTONOMY brainstorm (ADR-004, the big remaining half — not to start until he says so) or the smaller carried items (file-wide `safeLog` in server.ts; agent-ci synthetic `GITHUB_REPO`; dotted-id SPA-fallback root fix).

## s43 (2026-07-16) — s42 reply-B cycle LIVE-PROVEN (operator-attended) + blocked-state SHIPPED (narrator `blocked` + reply-B re-arm) — codex-gated + live-proven, branch `autodev/s43-narrator-blocked-state`

Operator opened with priority #1 (the deferred s42 reply-B daemon live-prove), then had me build the blocked-state (priority #2), all operator-attended.

**#1 — s42 reply-B daemon cycle LIVE-PROVEN.** On `woodev-shipping-plugin-test` through the real daemon + Chrome: a cart-fee task → worker wrote a genuine **method-id parsing** bug (compares only the prefix-before-colon to `get_method_id()`, breaks for full WC `method_id:instance_id` rate IDs) → **critic `broken 0.72`** (codex gpt-5.5) → escalate → **`critic-feedback.md` written** → operator clicked **B** → `onReplyRework`→drain→**re-run at round 0 unconditionally read the feedback** → worker fixed exactly that bug (`explode(':')` + prefix compare + a comment citing the WC rate-id format) → **critic `clean 0.79` → COMMIT `af8d856` → DONE**. Closes the one thing s42 deliberately deferred (s42 proved only the data path via unit+integration). **Env detour:** the opus decompose hung 5+min (vs ~13s); root cause = a memory-pressure pileup of **69 stale claude/node processes** across old sessions (gotcha s34) — the operator-authorized kill cleared it, decompose normal after. The classifier (correctly) blocked me from force-killing the pre-existing daemon until the operator explicitly authorized.

**#2 — blocked-state SHIPPED (resolves `[narrator/escalated-run-not-terminal]`, open since s40).** An escalation-parked run (no `active`/`pending` task, ≥1 `escalated`) is not terminal → the read-only NarratorService kept the thread `status:running` and idle-ticked every 1.5s forever. Fix (`3919377` feat + `0d78b52` gate-response): (a) a distinct **`blocked`** thread status + one-shot "waiting on your reply" note + `stop()` when nothing progresses but ≥1 task is escalated; (b) **reply-B re-arm** — `onReplyRework` now receives the task id; the composition root finds the blocked thread whose run manifest owns it, flips it back to `running`, and starts a fresh narrator bound to the SAME run (`boundRunId`, silent baseline → narrates only post-reply progress); (c) UI `blocked` glyph (PauseCircle/uncertain tone) + ThreadView badge. **1086 tests (+4 narrator), root+ui typecheck, both bundles green.** codex gpt-5.5 gate returned `uncertain`: findings #1 (baseline reads `escalated`) + #2 (concurrent double-narrator) **verified FALSE against the real code** (server.ts awaits the escalated→pending move BEFORE onReplyRework fires, and `escalated→pending` emits no cell; `startNarrator`'s stop-then-register is synchronous), #3 (a stale-run_id thread could stay `blocked` silently) closed with an **INFO re-arm log** (can't WARN on zero-match — a curl/direct run legitimately owns no thread). Codex tried to run on `gpt-5.6-sol` first (new, provisioned) but the CLI was too old → `400`; re-ran on `gpt-5.5`.

**Live-prove #2** (operator-attended, through the daemon+Chrome, launched via the s40 thread-chat so a narrator exists): pickup-fee task **escalated after 3 rounds** → thread went **BLOCKED** (badge + amber PauseCircle glyph + "waiting on your reply" note + narrator stopped, `meta.status:"blocked"`) → operator/agent reply-B → thread **`running` re-arm** (`meta.status:"running"` + the INFO `narrator: re-armed blocked thread ...` log fired) → the re-run **immediately poisoned** (see finding) → narrator handled the quarantine terminal → `error`, no wedge. **Earned its keep — new gotcha `[rework/reply-b-poisons-maxrounds-exhausted-task]` (GOTCHAS 66→67):** reply-B on a **round-exhausted** escalation doesn't re-run the worker; the drain re-claims and the conductor's poison-pill re-escalates as `poison`→quarantine in ~80ms (attempt budget not reset on reply-B). s42's cart-fee escalated after ONE round so its budget wasn't exhausted → reply-B re-ran fine; the two escalation classes behave differently. Conductor behaviour, not a blocked-state defect.

**End of session:** operator confirmed he **upgraded the codex CLI → gpt-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna now invokable**; FUTURE-BACKLOG updated (evaluate one as critic; the CLI blocker is resolved; PIN the model explicitly, the gate drifts onto the default otherwise). Demo junk cleaned (pickup thread/run/quarantine/runtime/escalation); test repo tree clean, queue empty (2 done). **NEXT (s44):** merge the PR, then operator picks — (a) the poison-on-reply-B fix, (b) gpt-5.6 critic calibration, or (c) the unattended-half autonomy brainstorm (ADR-004).

---

## s42 (2026-07-15) — two s41 structural findings FIXED + codex-gated + verified + MERGED (autonomous overnight) — PR #73 (`ffefeb7`), CI 4/4

Operator picked priorities **#1 (design talk: critic→CI / testless-repo blindspot) then #2 (reply-B rework)**, then granted full autonomy for the night with one hard rule: *don't claim done until it's verified working end-to-end*. Ran the design talk, then implemented both — subagent-gated (codex GPT-5.5) + TDD + verified.

**#1 — critic is a correctness gate, coverage is mechanical (ADR-005 + spec, commits `5fed5f0` docs, `21c8019` fix).** Design talk converged on a reframe: the critic conflated *correctness* (only an adversarial reader can catch — regressions, logic, fabricated proofs) with *coverage* (a new test locking new behavior — already the mechanical gate's job via zones + mutation-verified blessed guards). The old "missing guard → not clean" was a fuzzy LLM duplicate that (a) is redundant where a zone is declared and (b) is **unverifiable theater + blocks correct work** in a test-less repo. Decision (operator delegated it): **narrow the critic to correctness+fabrication; coverage is exclusively the mechanical gate + agent-ci.** Prompt-only change to `src/critic/prompt.ts`. **Rejected** reordering CI before the critic (the ordering problem was a symptom, not a defect; agent-ci is expensive + off-by-default). **Proven END-TO-END on the REAL codex critic** (the fix IS the prompt — unit tests can't prove it): correct getter, no test → **clean 0.82** (was `broken 0.73` live in s41); real load-order silent-skip → **broken 0.76** (gate stays real). codex gate: 1 false-positive blocker (mis-parsed inline diff) declined + 1 minor (heading too absolute) applied + re-verified E2E.

**#2 — reply-B rework carries the critic's objection (spec + commit `3fd977b`).** (a) escalation branch now writes `critic-feedback.md`; (b) round-0 read unconditional (fresh claim → no file → undefined; task ids unique per decompose); (c) reply-B fires best-effort `onReplyRework`→`conductor.run({drain})` so the reworked task actually runs (R1-thin trigger, only for B on a real move, guarded against a throwing hook). **Verified:** 3 conductor + 5 server unit tests + a **REAL repo+scheduler integration test** (feedback survives escalated→pending→re-claim — the gap fakes can't cover) + existing worker-adapter forwarding coverage + a **live daemon boot-smoke** (new dist assembles the ProjectView with onReplyRework, serves on :4320). codex gate: same inline-diff false-positive blocker declined + a genuine `major` (unguarded fire-and-forget hook could break the 200) applied (try/catch at the server boundary + a throwing-hook test).

**Gate:** 1082 tests / 3 skip, root typecheck + build green. New gotcha `[critic/codex]` (codex's inline-embedded diff strips string quotes → false "invalid syntax" blocker — hit TWICE this session; verify against typecheck/build/tests, decline). GOTCHAS 65→66; `[gate/critic-before-ci-blocks-testless-repos]` + `[rework/reply-b-drops-critic-feedback]` marked RESOLVED.

**Deliberately NOT done (overnight rule "stop before expensive unsupervised live runs"):** the full LLM reply-B→rework→clean **daemon** cycle (needs an unattended worker+critic run; the fix's data path is fully proven without it) — flagged for an operator-attended live-prove. **Merged:** PR #73 → main (`ffefeb7`), CI green 4/4 (ubuntu+windows × node 20/22), branch deleted. **Next:** operator-attended reply-B daemon proof if wanted; then chat polish (`[narrator/escalated-run-not-terminal]`), then unattended autonomy (ADR-004).

## s41 (2026-07-13) — first REAL CI run on a real task, operator-observable → DONE + commit (`3609a2c`); 4 findings; no production code

Ran a genuine task on the one real registered project (`woodev-shipping-plugin-test`, a WooCommerce shipping plugin) THROUGH the browser thread UI,
operator watching. Goal: an operator-observable end-to-end DONE (s40 lesson: no curl-narrated happy paths). It took **4 attempts** to reach a clean DONE —
that IS the story: the live-prove earned its keep with 4 real findings.

**Setup (committed to the test repo `autodev/main` / local `.autodev/`):**
- Authored `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (php -l; no composer.json exists so composer-based CI was a no-go), then reshaped it to **agent-ci-runnable**:
  `container: php:8.3-cli`, NO `actions/checkout` (empirically verified in WSL — `setup-php` and `checkout` both fail under agent-ci; container-php-no-checkout
  runs green because agent-ci mounts the workspace). Commits `40460a2` → `3bb2a9e`.
- Enabled `gate.agentCi` (`.autodev/config.yaml`: `checkCommand: null`, `agentCi.enabled: true`, `workflows: [.github/workflows/ci.yml]`); roles sonnet/sonnet/codex.
- Neutralized `.serena` churn (skip-worktree + exclude); filled GOAL.md; verified WSL Ubuntu + docker-desktop (Docker 29.4.0) + node-in-WSL → capability `wsl`.

**The 4-attempt arc (all watched live):**
1. **WC_Integration feature** → worker wrote a clean self-contained integration → **critic `broken 0.78`** (real: `add_filter` under a load-time `class_exists` can
   silently skip; text-domain) → escalated. Operator chose reply-**B**. **Finding 1** `[rework/reply-b-drops-critic-feedback]`: reply-B never conveys the critic's
   objection to the re-run (no `critic-feedback.md` on the contract-risk escalation branch; round-0 re-claim doesn't read it) → would loop; also doesn't auto-drain.
2. **Refined (deferred `plugins_loaded`)** → load-order fixed → **critic `broken 0.78` again**: the file is **dead code** (nothing requires it; no autoloader) — correct refusal.
3. Operator steer: critic is proven, **CI is the priority** (never ran on a real task). **Trivial correct getter** → **critic `broken 0.73`** "missing coverage/guard for a new
   public contract." **Finding 2** `[gate/critic-before-ci-blocks-testless-repos]`: the critic HARD-demands a guard/test (prompt-level, not effort-tunable) and CI is gated
   BEHIND critic-clean → in a test-less repo no feature reaches CI.
4. **Behavior-neutral docblock** → nothing to guard → **critic CLEAN** → gate → **agent-ci replayed the real `ci.yml` GREEN (5/5, `run-finish: passed`, ~2.6s)** →
   **COMMIT + MERGE → DONE** (`3609a2c`). CI observability worked live (CI block running→passed, `AGENT_CI ci: event` cells, `open CI run →`, merge cell, DONE badge).

**Findings 3–4** (from the WSL de-risking): `[gate/agent-ci-needs-github-remote-slug]` (agent-ci needs a GitHub remote or `GITHUB_REPO`; worked via `origin=kalbac/...`),
`[gate/agent-ci-workflow-container-no-checkout]` (the workflow-shape matrix above). RE-CONFIRMED live: `[narrator/escalated-run-not-terminal]`. **GOTCHAS 61→65.**
No harness production code changed — deliverable = the findings + a working CI-gate recipe. **Next (s42):** design talk on critic→CI ordering (finding 2), then fix
finding 1, then chat polish (`blocked` state), then the deferred unattended-autonomy brainstorm.

## s40 (2026-07-12) — live orchestrator ATTENDED PRESENCE shipped (thread-chat main screen), codex-CLEAN + live-proven → PR #72 MERGED (`4c34ee1`)

Executed the s40 plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-live-orchestrator-attended-presence.md`, written this session over the s39 spec)
subagent-driven (Sonnet + Opus workers by complexity, mandatory codex GPT-5.5 gate). Built the **attended half of ADR-004**: chat is the project's
main screen, a thread = one intent/run persisted on the blackboard. 30 commits across 6 phases:
- **A — primitives:** thread entry/meta zod schemas, `ThreadStore` (append-only `.autodev/threads/<id>/`, byte-counter cap, symlink-guarded, best-effort),
  `ThreadEventBus`+`handleThreadStream` (replay→live, copies s38 CI-stream incl. the disconnect-leak fix + flushHeaders), batch+streaming fenced-json
  strippers (agreement-tested), launch marker.
- **B — pre-launch:** surgical `ChatSessionManager.start(sink?)` so the OPENING TURN STREAMS (+ `forwardToken` pre-registration fallback — the real
  dead-air killer; the s34 manager dropped opening tokens); `ThreadChatService` (thread↔session map, per-turn stripper→bus, persist stripped prose+plan,
  launch-by-word with guards, confirm→narrator handoff); `performLaunch` extracted res-decoupled (R1 intact — still only `onOrchestrate`).
- **C — narrator:** pure `diffRunSnapshot` + `coalesceMilestones`, prompt builders, `runOrchestratorOneShot` (`claude -p` stream-json), `NarratorService`
  (read-only tick→instant cells + one-shot milestone narration + mid-run Q&A + run-discovery w/ fail-visible timeout + prune-on-terminal), `buildRunSnapshot`.
- **D — transport:** 7 thread routes + `ProjectView.threads` + composition wiring + shutdown teardown.
- **E — UI:** `ThreadView` main screen, `ThreadTranscript` (MessageScroller+Bubble), `ActivityCell` (Collapsible+Badge, deep-links), `PlanChip` (wrap-fix
  + Launch), `ThreadList` sidebar, `NewRunComposer` start/send; `ChatModal` deleted; SessionRail + cell contrast fixed (polish #3).
- **Gate:** 1071 tests/3 skip, root+ui typecheck+build green. **codex GPT-5.5 FULL cycle** — R1 review: 9 findings (1 sendMessage-rejection, launch-guard,
  fail-closed loggers, wrong-run-binding, restart id-collision, stripper-tail, batch/stream fence disagreement, opening-race, narrator-map leak) → fixed →
  3 remaining (launch fence bypass, run-binding heuristic ×2) → 2 fixed (unterminated-fence + normalize/timeout) → 1 High (unterminated fence) → fixed →
  **CLEAN**. R1 boundary confirmed intact. 2 run-binding Mediums (hard run-id correlation) declined-with-rationale (verbatim-intent flow + s32 dedup +
  fail-visible timeout; belongs to s41+ overnight) — codex acknowledged.
- **LIVE-PROVEN** through the real daemon + Chrome (`s40-demo` throwaway): streaming opening turn, launch-by-word → real run → **DONE + commit `08551a2`**
  (critic CLEAN), self-narration (cells + prose), deep-link merge→TaskDetail, mid-run Q&A, red-path escalation narrated (critic `broken` on an invented FAQ).
  **Earned its keep — 2 unit-invisible bugs:** (1) `chat-prompt.ts` never taught the model the `[[LAUNCH]]` marker → launch-by-word was dead (backend
  detected, model never emitted); (2) dotted thread-id (`FAQ.md`) → static SPA-fallback 404 on reload → strip dots in `mintThreadId`. Both fixed +
  re-confirmed codex CLEAN, CI 4/4, merged.
- **GOTCHAS 58→61:** `[chat/launch-marker-needs-prompt-contract]`, `[ui/dotted-id-breaks-spa-reload]`, `[narrator/escalated-run-not-terminal]`.
- **Operator verdict:** "намного лучше — есть ощущение живого чата," but the browser demo did NOT show him a convincing end-to-end (he watched a hung run
  + escalations; the clean DONE ran via curl before he was watching). **Lesson banked:** a live-prove has to be operator-OBSERVABLE end-to-end in the
  browser, not a curl-driven happy path narrated after the fact. **NEXT (s41): a real-project real-task run, observable end-to-end + chat polish**
  (escalated-run "blocked" state + idle-tick stop first); unattended-half autonomy brainstorm deferred behind it.

## s39 — 2026-07-12 — **direction session (Fable 5): live-orchestrator doctrine → ADR-004 accepted + s40 attended-presence spec** — DOCS-ONLY

**The talk (operator's call from s38, no building).** Operator opened with two clarifications: "never merge bullshit"
is ACHIEVED (esp. with agent-ci), and the name *autodev* implies the missing half — unattended end-to-end progress;
slogan extended to **"Stop babysitting and never let agents merge bullshit."** Converged diagnosis: felt-deadness and
no-autonomy share one root cause — the live orchestrator was amputated into a one-shot decompose pipeline (`handleIntent`
is a staged, terminating pipeline by design); ONE persistent-orchestrator component fixes both: **narrator when attended,
worker when overnight**. Operator's pain named precisely: agents block overnight on questions they could decide
themselves — flip **pre-approval → post-review** (decide reversible forks, journal them, review in the morning); the
deterministic gate is what makes that safe. His additions: a "does this match the project concept?" self-check before
any autonomous decision (→ per-project **north-star** doc), and an explicit **Overnight** toggle with wider privileges.

**Doctrine → `adr/004` (accepted, sign-off in-session):** 6 tenets — one component/two modes; post-review; 3 decision
classes (block parks the task, never the queue; operator UI/UX taste is always class 3); north-star check (anti-drift at
decision granularity; run-level anti-drift becomes mandatory for autonomy); Overnight = global top-bar toggle (autonomy
is a function of operator presence); adr/003 R1 boundary untouched.

**UX brainstorm (superpowers:brainstorming, ASCII mockups, every fork operator-picked):** chat = the project's MAIN
screen (ChatModal dies); thread = intent/run with a sidebar thread list (Claude Code Desktop IA); prose + instant
machine activity-cells (cells deep-link to RunView/CiRunView/TaskDetail); launch via plan-chip button AND
conversational word (both → the unchanged R1 confirm path; LAUNCH control-marker guarded by operator-turn + plan-exists);
SessionRail stays status-only; narrator architecture = **hybrid A+B** — live `ChatSessionManager` pre-launch (s34
machinery; the opening turn MUST stream — kills the 10-15s dead air) + event-driven one-shot narration post-launch over
blackboard-persisted threads (`.autodev/threads/<id>/thread.ndjson`, SSE replay→live per the s38 CI pattern; narrator
best-effort, restart-safe). **Spec:** `superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-live-orchestrator-attended-presence-design.md`
(attended presence ONLY; operator approved in-chat and waived file review). s38 polish bugs #1/#2 absorbed (modal dies);
FUTURE-BACKLOG "Orchestrator CHAT" marked superseded. Meta-note banked: the operator observed this session's
recommendations matched his preferences "100%" — because they were READ from his recorded feedback, not guessed; that is
the north-star mechanism demonstrated live.

**Next (s40, operator picked Opus 4.8):** writing-plans over the spec → subagent-driven build → codex gate → live-prove
through daemon+browser on the FELT criterion. Overnight/autonomy = s41+ brainstorm on ADR-004.

## s38 — 2026-07-11 — **agent-ci observability** (cross-platform WSL invocation + live CI visibility) — BUILT, codex-CLEAN, LIVE-PROVEN end-to-end (happy DONE+commit AND red RETRY)

**Scope.** Executed the s38 plan (`2026-07-11-agent-ci-observability.md`) subagent-driven (Sonnet workers + per-module
spec/quality review + mandatory codex GPT-5.5 gate). Makes the off-by-default `gate.agentCi` step cross-platform + observable.
Branch `autodev/s38-agent-ci-observability` (21 commits, HEAD `0809fa2`).

**Backend (Tasks 1-8).** Typed `AgentCiEvent` + `parseAgentCiEvent` (event-keyed) + `deriveWorkflowVerdict`; cross-platform
capability (`detectAgentCiCapability` native/wsl/unavailable, `winToWslPath`, `buildAgentCiCommand`) + streaming spawner;
streaming refactor of `agent-ci.ts` (contract `{green,reasons}`/throw-on-infra UNCHANGED) + typed `AgentCiUnavailableError`;
`taskId` threaded into the gate; `CiEventBus` + SSE (history-replay→live) + capability handler; `root.ts` `onEvent` persist
(ndjson + status.json) + publish; honest `needs-WSL` escalation reason; `index.ts` wiring. **UI (Tasks 9-12, review-only):**
api/query/SSE hooks (`useCiEvents`); CI block in SessionRail (enabled-gated); `CiRunView` live step-tree screen; RunView link +
Settings capability line.

**Gate.** 981 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck+build green. **codex GPT-5.5 ran 4 passes:** backend R1 — 1 Critical (timeout
passed after a terminal event → made timeout throw infra) + 2 High (**WSL path never mapped — `winToWslPath` was DEAD CODE**;
unmappable path ≠ unavailable) + 2 Medium (SSE replay-disconnect leak; unbounded ndjson) → fixed; R2 — 1 Medium (ndjson cap
off-by-marker) → fixed; the GIT_DIR fix → CLEAN; the two live-prove git-fixes → CLEAN. Re-critic every in-place fix.

**LIVE-PROVEN through the REAL daemon + Chrome (WSL+Docker).** Happy path (`agentci-live4`): a real task ran opus-decompose →
sonnet-worker → gate(check + **agent-ci full CI in WSL, 6/6 steps passed**) → codex-critic clean → COMMIT → merge → **DONE, real
commit `565b93c` on autodev/main**; CI screen streamed the green step-tree live ("agent_ci_green ✓ → gate COMMIT unaffected");
Settings showed "agent-ci ● VIA WSL"; `/ci/capability` returned `wsl`. Red path (`agentci-red`, failing workflow): CI screen red
tree with `failing-check` red + "agent_ci_green ✗ → gate RETRY (failed: failing-check)" + CI block "failed (step …)".

**The live-prove earned its keep AGAIN** (per the operator's philosophy) — the observability CODE was correct throughout, but
driving the full worker→gate→**merge** flow surfaced TWO Windows↔WSL git-interop blockers unit tests could never see: (1) agent-ci
can't resolve `HEAD` in a Windows-created git worktree (the `.git` gitdir pointer is a Windows path WSL git can't follow) → only
`run.start` → infra-escalate on every run; (2) agent-ci MUTATES the shared `.git/config` (flips `core.bare=true`; `GIT_WORK_TREE`
persists `core.worktree=/mnt`) → corrupts the main repo → conductor's post-gate merge breaks. Fixes: derive the WSL gitdir + set
**`GIT_DIR` only** (never `GIT_WORK_TREE`) + **snapshot/restore `.git/config`** around the run. → gotcha
`[gate/agent-ci-worktree-wsl-git-interop]` (GOTCHAS 57→58). Demo projects + daemon cleaned; the WSL `actions-runner` image kept.

**Merged + demoed.** Pushed → PR #71 → CI green 4/4 (ubuntu+windows × node 20/22) → **merged to main (`0e68aeb`)** per the
standing grant (codex-clean + green CI). Then brought the daemon up and the operator **re-ran the full pipeline himself in the
browser** (fresh `agentci-demo`, workflow slowed with `sleep` steps so the CI tree streams watchably) → **confirmed working
end-to-end** (a second real commit landed). Found 3 UX polish bugs (parked in FUTURE-BACKLOG): the pre-launch chat leaks the raw
```json decompose output + its plan chip overflows the viewport; the SessionRail CI block "open CI run →" link is near-invisible.
All s38 test projects + artifacts cleaned; registry back to just `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`. honest-unavailable path is
unit-proven + identical machinery (this box has WSL, so it wasn't driven live).

**Operator reflection → s39 is a DIRECTION talk, not a build.** The engine works and the gate demonstrably catches real bugs, but
the operator flagged the harness feels **"not alive"**: launch → 10-15s dead-air → a transactional modal he dislikes → 'Launch &
Run' → more silence → a Session Inspector that shows state but doesn't NARRATE. The original autodev-loop (`D:\Projects\woodev_framework`)
felt alive because a LIVE narrating orchestrator (Claude Code) was in the loop, watching + reporting. He wrapped it into the harness
for 4 real wins (auto-orchestrate / universal / multi-OS / visibility) — but in gaining structure it lost the live-companion soul.
**s39 opens on a philosophical/direction conversation (his call, model = Fable 5): how to put the live, streaming, narrating
orchestrator presence back in without losing the 4 wins.** Framing + his exact words captured in `next-session-promt.md`.

## s37 — 2026-07-10 — **agent-ci gate hardening** (optional local-CI-replay gate step) → **PR #69**, codex-CLEAN + LIVE-PROVEN

**Scope.** Implemented the s33 spec (`2026-07-08-agent-ci-gate-hardening-design.md`) — an OPTIONAL, off-by-default,
config-gated ADDITIONAL machine-gate step replaying a project's real GitHub Actions CI locally (`@redwoodjs/agent-ci`)
in the per-task worktree BEFORE commit. Subagent-driven (Sonnet workers per module + mandatory codex GPT-5.5 gate).
Wrote the plan first (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-agent-ci-gate-hardening.md`), grounded in the real code.

**Build (7 commits).** (1) `schema.ts` `gate.agentCi.{enabled,workflows,timeoutMs}` all-defaulted → opted-out = byte-identical.
(2) `gate/agent-ci.ts` new pure `runAgentCiWorkflows`: sequential `npx @redwoodjs/agent-ci run --workflow <p> --json` per
allowlisted workflow; **job-fail→RETURN `{green:false}`, infra-fail→THROW** (the throw-vs-return split IS the contract).
(3) `gate.ts` step "1c" after `success_commands` + `agent_ci_green` verdict field + `||!agentCiGreen` RETRY fold; the throw
propagates out of `runGate` uncaught (conductor already escalates gate throws, `conductor.ts:474`). (4) `root.ts` wires
`runAgentCi` like `runCheck` (null when disabled; enabled+empty-allowlist→WARN+skip). (5) config-preservation regression
test (a UI `checkCommand` save keeps a hand-set `gate.agentCi` — `mergeConfigYaml` spreads `...raw.gate`).

**Gate discipline.** 934 tests/3 skip, typecheck+build(root+ui) green. **codex GPT-5.5 gate ran 3 rounds.** R1: 2 Sev-2 —
(a) the `Promise.race` timeout threw but never killed the agent-ci/Docker child → leak; fix = pass `timeoutMs` INTO the
runner so `runNative` reaps it (SIGTERM→SIGKILL), race stays as the throw-contract guarantee; (b) parser OR'd pass/fail
across all terminal events → a late `{status:cancelled}` after `{status:passed}` misread as pass; fix = last-terminal-wins
+ unknown-terminal→failed (fail-closed, never COMMIT on ambiguity) → re-critic CLEAN. Then the LIVE-PROVE found a real
correctness bug → fix → final codex **CLEAN**.

**Live-prove (operator chose full).** Docker 29.4 present. agent-ci **does not run on native Windows** (dies pre-Docker on
`tar -czf C:\...` — Unix-tar reads `C:` as a remote host) → proved the **infra-fail branch for real** (module + `runGate`
both throw → escalate). Ran the **pass/job-fail branches under WSL** (node22 + Docker there): real agent-ci pulled the
490MB actions-runner image and ran real containers. **Captured the REAL NDJSON — and it broke the parser:** events are
keyed by **`event`**, not the initially-guessed `type` (`{"event":"run.finish","status":"passed"|"failed"}`). Keyed on
`type`, EVERY real run (pass or fail) would have parsed as infra→throw→escalate — green unit tests, 100% useless in
production. Fix = `obj.event ?? obj.type` (type kept as a defensive fallback) + two VERBATIM real-NDJSON regression tests.
**All 3 branches then proven end-to-end via the real built module:** pass→module `{green:true}`→gate `COMMIT`;
job-fail→`{green:false}`→gate `RETRY`; infra→throw→escalate.

**Docs/gotchas.** GOTCHAS 55→57: `[gate/agent-ci-not-runnable-on-native-windows]` (feature is Linux/WSL-only in practice;
Windows always infra-escalates — the correct fail-safe), `[gate/agent-ci-ndjson-keyed-by-event-not-type]` (the guessed-shape
trap; live-prove earned its keep, same class as the s32 dedup lesson). **Result: PR #69 MERGED** (`d5d5808`).

**Addendum — operator battle-test + redirect (same session).** After the merge the operator pushed back, rightly: he never
saw Docker spin up or any process IN the harness, because my live-prove ran through the built MODULE directly (a throwaway
`prove.mjs`) and under WSL — NOT through the daemon/UI. Reconciled honestly: the run WAS real (real containers, real NDJSON)
but module-level, and v1 has no UI + doesn't run on his native-Windows harness. He redirected: don't rush polish — make
agent-ci **observable in the harness UI** and **runnable from his Windows box** (product for Windows/Mac/Linux + a future
Tauri/Electron wrap; Windows users get an honest "needs WSL" message). Brainstormed (ASCII mockups, no browser companion)
to locked decisions: **invocation** = cross-platform, Windows proxies into WSL (`wsl -e` + `/mnt` path map) with honest
capability reporting; **CI screen depth** = live step tree, no raw logs (logs = v2); **transport** = hybrid (persist
`agent-ci-events.ndjson` + SSE). Wrote the design spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-agent-ci-observability-design.md`
(mockups approved). **Artifacts cleaned** (WSL test repo/state, Windows scratchpad, containers; only the 490MB actions-runner
image kept for the next real run). **Next session: operator reviews the spec → writing-plans → subagent-driven build,
live-proven THROUGH the daemon+browser.**

## s36 — 2026-07-09 — Component-currency **Tier 2** (8 items) + native shell + desktop responsiveness → **MERGED (PR #65 `a5efbb5`)**, + 2 polish fixes (**PR #66 `2bab3c7`**)

**Scope.** Executed all of Tier 2 from the s35 audit, subagent-driven (Sonnet workers + mandatory codex GPT-5.5 gate
per module), browser-proven, ONE PR. Operator added a cross-cutting ask up front: **desktop responsiveness** (no mobile)
— the shell had ~zero (556px fixed chrome: sidebar 256 + rail 300 starved `main` at every width).

**8 items (each codex CLEAN or CLEAN-after-fix):** (1) **toggle-group** — SettingsPopover theme + Inspector file-chips
(1 Low `min-w-fit`). (2) **sidebar block + responsiveness** — shell rebuilt on the base-nova `sidebar` block
(`collapsible=icon`); a controlled `SidebarProvider` + matchMedia controller auto-collapses <1280 (Ctrl/⌘B overrides
until the next breakpoint cross), the session rail auto-hides <1120 behind a floating overlay toggle; project rows →
`SidebarMenu` (mount-gated fetch preserved; letter-avatars collapsed). (3) **native inset refine** (operator UI
feedback mid-session, ref dashboard-01) — `variant="inset"` (sidebar + content read as SEPARATE panels); footer
rebuilt as the native `DropdownMenu` NavUser pattern; daemon status → `Badge`. (4) **chips → Badge/Button** (codex 1
Med `zone`-marker-got-a-pill → reverted to span + 1 Low font-normal). (5) **checkbox** (codex 1 Med — sibling
`htmlFor` doesn't toggle a span-rooted Base UI checkbox → wrapping `<label>`). (6) **alert-dialog** — EscalationCard
gate-override confirm (custom async/broken-tone Buttons kept, not AlertDialogAction). (7) **collapsible** — DigestStrip.
(8) **input-group** — NewRunComposer shell (codex 2 Low → `focus-within:border-ring` [was control-only] + `flex-wrap`
footer); ChatModal composer left as-is (different shape). Operator chose "all Tier 2 incl. input-group" over my
churn-skip recommendation.

**Verification.** ui typecheck + build green every commit; **codex GPT-5.5 gate on every module**; browser live-proof
(real daemon + Chrome): 3-region shell light+dark, Ctrl+B icon-collapse (avatars, main reclaims ~208px), inset floating
card, native footer DropdownMenu + `daemon live` badge + theme keep-open, composer focus (--border→--ring, ring glow
suppressed), TaskCard chips compact. CI green 4/4. Rail-hide <1120 + alert-dialog confirm NOT live-clicked (window
clamps ~1295px CSS; no escalation to reach) — logic + codex verified.

**Polish (PR #66, operator-reported bugs).** (1) SidebarRail resize-cursor artifact → removed (`<SidebarRail/>`
redundant given header trigger + Ctrl/⌘B + auto-collapse). (2) Collapsed-footer gear mis-rendered → **root cause
(gotcha 54): tailwind-merge doesn't dedupe `important` + arbitrary-variant utilities**, so the block's `size=lg`
`group-data-[collapsible=icon]:p-0!` lost to base `p-2!` (stylesheet order) → 16px content box clipped the size-8
square. Fix: bare `size-4` gear (native default-button collapse, zero crutches; operator vetoed a `hidden`-style hack).
Operator approved the trade-off (lost the accent tile). Couldn't screenshot the below-fold footer (box browser died);
fix root-cause-confirmed by live measurement + operator eyeball.

**New gotchas (2): 53→55** — `[ui/twmerge-important-arbitrary-variant-no-dedupe]` (54), `[ui/base-ui-checkbox-wrapping-label]` (55).
**Vendored primitives:** toggle-group/toggle, sidebar/sheet/use-mobile, checkbox, alert-dialog, collapsible, input-group
+ `use-media-query` — all Base UI, zero radix; block `button` deps rewired to custom `Button` (Windows collision, gotcha 62).

## s35 — 2026-07-09 — Component-currency migration **Tier 1** → **MERGED (PR #63, `de57d6c`)**

**Context.** Operator ask carried from s34 (prompted by the s34 `MessageScroller` miss — shipped a generic component
where a purpose-built one existed): with the shadcn MCP now LIVE, review EVERY UI component vs the current catalog and
adopt purpose-built primitives — "task-maximum," including blocks and the Skills docs.

**The reframe (gotcha 53).** Our `components.json` style is `base-nova` (shadcn on **Base UI**). The shadcn MCP's item
metadata reports the **default-style (Radix)** deps, so I (and the 3 audit subagents I briefed with that metadata) first
tagged `bubble`/`item`/`sidebar`/`collapsible`/`tabs`/`toggle-group`/`checkbox`/`alert-dialog` as "FOUNDATION-COST (radix)."
Fetching the raw `base-nova` registry JSON (`ui.shadcn.com/r/styles/base-nova/<item>.json`) proved that WRONG: base-nova
ships **Base-UI ports of the whole catalog** — none pull Radix. So there is no foundation trap; the real adoption filter
is value/churn/behaviour. Rewrote the audit accordingly (`docs/wiki/component-currency-audit-s35.md`, Tier 1/2/3).

**Method.** Recon via 3 parallel Explore agents over all 18 composites + 7 custom primitives + 15 vendored, cross-checked
against the live catalog (61 `ui` items + blocks) and the Skills docs (an AI-assist skill ≈ the MCP we already have;
useful byproduct: `shadcn diff` for drift). Operator chose "Tier 1 now, Tier 2 item-by-item."

**Tier 1 shipped (5 commits, subagent/main-session mix).** Vendored 6 base-nova primitives (spinner/empty/kbd/label/
field/bubble) via curl-the-registry-JSON + alias/icon rewrites (gotcha `[ui/shadcn-cli-vendor-windows]`; no `button` dep
→ no Windows case-collision). **Keystone:** rebuilt `Feedback.tsx` — `Spinner` wraps shadcn `spinner` (muted default
kept), `EmptyState` is a shadcn `empty` composition; public signatures unchanged so every caller (Inspector ×4, all
Loading spinners) inherits the primitive with zero caller edits. Then: SessionRail `Loader2`→`Spinner`; RuntimeFileView
"Select a file" + EscalationCard "No record" panel-empties→`EmptyState` (small inline one-liners in dropdown/sidebar/
log-tail deliberately KEPT as idiomatic muted text — forcing `empty` there is an anti-pattern); ChatModal `ChatBubble`→
shadcn `bubble` (chose `bubble` over the audit's `message` — it's the purpose-built tinted bubble; dropped the unused
`message` primitive); NewRunComposer ⌘⏎→`kbd`; RegisterForm 4 input fields→`field` (mono micro-label preserved via
twMerge overrides; form-level error kept as `text-broken`, not `FieldError`'s `text-destructive`); SettingsPopover
hand-rolled `h-px` divider→`separator`. NewRunComposer textarea→`input-group` and RegisterForm checkbox→`checkbox`
correctly deferred to Tier 2 (the composer textarea is intentionally borderless-in-a-card; vendored Textarea fights that).

**Gate.** root+ui typecheck ✓, ui vite build ✓, **independent codex GPT-5.5 full-diff gate: CLEAN, 0 findings** (verified
alias/icon rewrites, preserved signatures, `whitespace-pre-wrap`, twMerge override order, no dead refs). **Browser
live-proof** on a real daemon (:4319) + real project + real Chrome: `bubble` BOTH variants in a real end-to-end
`claude -p` chat (operator=primary/right, assistant=outline/left), `kbd` key-caps, `spinner` (chatStart), `Tabs`
switching + `VerdictSeal` CLEAN + `DiffView` colored diff — zero layout breakage across home/run/task. **CI green 4/4.**
Merged PR #63 (merge commit `de57d6c`) — merge-commit to preserve M1–M4 module history. GOTCHAS 52→53.

**Next (s36): Tier 2, item-by-item, subagent-driven (Sonnet 5 + codex critic)** — `toggle-group` (theme), `checkbox`,
`input-group`, `collapsible`/`accordion`, `alert-dialog`, big `sidebar` block LAST; + Badge/Button chip consolidation +
vendored-primitive drift spot-check. Stopped here (not starting Tier 2 this session) to keep a fresh context for it —
operator's own condition. Env note: box at ~743MB free (stale node procs); the classifier blocks mass-killing unidentified
node procs — start the daemon anyway (it's light) rather than force-cleaning.

## s34 — 2026-07-08/09 — Orchestrator pre-launch chat: executed the whole s33 plan (12 tasks) → **MERGED (PR #62, `5989c26`)**

**What shipped.** The fire-and-forget "type intent → Launch → silence" flow is replaced by a live multi-turn `claude -p`
chat: `ChatModal` streams the orchestrator's replies token-by-token over SSE, shows a live proposed-plan preview, and
only an explicit Confirm & Launch fires the exact same unchanged `handleIntent`/`POST /orchestrate` path (adr/003
R1-safe — the chat never gains enqueue/trigger). Backend: shared JSON-array extractor, `stream-json` wire parser,
`ClaudeChatProcess` (live multi-turn child, `--safe-mode`+`--strict-mcp-config`+`--tools ""` isolated),
`ClaudeOrchestratorChatAdapter`, `ChatSessionManager` (registry/idle-reaper/one-per-project guard/SSE-detach/
start-timeout/close-on-unregister), 5 HTTP routes (start/stream/message/confirm/cancel) with a clean `launchOrchestrate`
extraction, composition-root + real-`ProjectView` wiring. UI: chat API client + hooks, `ChatModal` on shadcn's
`MessageScroller`, wired from `NewRunComposer` (digest-watch toast preserved).

**Discipline.** Subagent-driven (Sonnet 5 implementer TDD → spec-check → independent codex GPT-5.5 gate → fix +
regression test → re-critic) per module. Codex found and fixed a REAL bug in nearly every task (stderr-pipe hang,
SIGKILL timer leak, oversized-line silent hang, isError swallowed, cancel-before-launch data loss, dead-SSE writes,
throwing-sink gaps, and the standout `onToken`-bound-once streaming break). **Full-diff codex gate then ran 9 rounds** —
each surfacing a genuine session/process-lifecycle edge (stale-session confirm, shutdown-race leak, close-during-start
resurrection, confirm-during-active-turn, unbounded opening-turn hang → permanent slot lock, a self-inflicted timer
leak in THAT fix, chat-leak-on-unregister/evict, stale-SSE-token duplicate bubble) — all fixed; final round CLEAN, 0
findings. **913 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck+build green, CI green 4/4** (ubuntu+windows × node 20/22).

**LIVE-PROVEN twice.** (1) curl on aurora: real `claude -p opus` chat spawn, live SSE frames, `--safe-mode` in the real
spawn args, clean cancel (no orphan), confirm → real decompose/worker/critic — the critic correctly ESCALATED a
chat-guessed wrong assumption (no `PROVIDERS` map exists) rather than fabricating a commit, proving "chat is
advisory-only". (2) Real Chrome browser: ChatModal opens, streams, auto-scrolls, proposed-plan preview, multi-turn
continuity, Confirm & Launch → dashboard RUNNING → CLEAN → **real commit `a794b88` landed on aurora**; Cancel enqueues
nothing + releases the slot; MessageScroller auto-scroll + stale-token gate verified.

**Operator-driven improvement + follow-ups.** Operator caught that the chat transcript used a generic `ScrollArea`
where shadcn's purpose-built `MessageScroller` existed (a real methodology miss — worked from the locally-vendored
shadcn set, not the live catalog). Swapped to `MessageScroller` (`9f4d1d0`, browser-verified auto-scroll — closed the
backlogged auto-scroll gap). Added a project `.mcp.json` wiring the **shadcn MCP** (project-level per operator; live
next session after a restart) + backlogged a **component-currency audit** of all UI components vs the current catalog.

**Environment note.** This box was under severe memory pressure from stale MCP-server/dev-server processes accumulated
across PRIOR sessions (weeks old) — operator-approved cleanup unblocked the codex reviewer. Reliable workarounds:
`curl -N` for SSE, and the inline-diff-with-no-tools-preamble `codex task` recipe when the sandboxed `git diff` failed.

**New gotcha:** `[chat/onToken-bound-once]` (count 51) — a session's `onToken` is bound ONCE for the process's whole
lifetime, so live streaming silently never worked past the opening turn until it looked up the live sink per token.

## s33 — 2026-07-08 — TWO discussion-first agenda items → two committed specs (no code yet)

**Item 1 — Orchestrator CHAT brainstorm → spec → plan.** Resolved the load-bearing `adr/003` question first: a
pre-launch chat is R1-safe as long as it stays a preview layer over the same 4 orchestrator capabilities
(enqueue/trigger/read/report) — the ONLY write into enforcement stays the existing, unchanged `handleIntent`, fired
once on explicit "Confirm & Launch" (finalIntent assembled from the operator's OWN messages, never the LLM's).
Operator chose the maximal-scope options: pre-enqueue-only (v1), genuine conversational replies (not raw
TaskSpec[]), and a truly **live, multi-turn `claude -p` process held open for the whole chat** (not per-turn
history-restuffing). **Live-verified the wire format myself** (spawned real `claude -p --input-format stream-json
--output-format stream-json`, fed 2 turns over one process's stdin) before writing the plan — confirmed the
session_id-stable process + `content_block_delta`/`result` event shapes used throughout. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-orchestrator-chat-design.md` (`fa96605`). Plan (12 tasks, TDD, grounded in the
real transcript, not guessed): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-08-orchestrator-chat.md` (`294a78c`). **Not started
— execution mode (subagent-driven vs inline) not yet chosen.**

**Item 2 — `redwoodjs/agent-ci` recon → corrected verdict → spec.** Recon-first (real README/LICENSE/shipped Claude
skill/blog, not the name): it's a local-GitHub-Actions-fidelity/speed tool for a single agent's pre-push loop
("CI becomes a formality — a verification of something you already proved"), NOT an orchestrator — near-zero
overlap with our 6 frozen-skeleton axes. Wrote `docs/wiki/agent-ci-analysis.md` (`b330656`). **Operator corrected my
framing**: not a replace-anything pitch, an optional STRENGTHEN of "never merge bullshit" (real downstream GH
Actions CI today has zero pre-merge visibility from our gate — a genuine gap). Re-briefed as its own brainstorm →
design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-agent-ci-gate-hardening-design.md` (`72a09d8`) — folds into the
EXISTING `RETRY`/`ESCALATE`/`COMMIT` machinery with zero new Decision/escalation types: a genuine workflow failure
→ RETRY (like `success_commands`); a Docker/agent-ci infra failure → throws, reusing the already-existing
"gate threw → broken operator config" escalation path. Opt-in, off by default, explicit workflow allowlist (never
`--all`, to avoid an accidental deploy-workflow run). **Plan not yet written.**

**No code changed this session** — both items were deliberately discussion-first per the operator's ask; three docs
commits landed (specs + analysis + backlog entries), zero production diffs. Memory updated mid-session
(`feedback-decide-dont-ask`): operator wants product/UX-shaping questions during brainstorm, NOT a
section-by-section technical-architecture approval loop — decide the plumbing solo, bring back a finished design.

---

## s32 — 2026-07-08 — agency-agents pivot + 3 backlog features (PRs #55/#56) + live proofs

**Pivot:** studied `github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents` (MIT) vs the operator's 5-way frame → **#4 Not for us** — a
~280-file persona-prompt library + multi-tool installer, not an orchestrator (installs prompt files, doesn't run agents;
no gate/isolation/blackboard/merge). Wrote `docs/wiki/agency-agents-analysis.md` + a worker-persona-catalog FUTURE-BACKLOG
item (its wordpress/drupal personas fit the woodev stack). Operator: "record the catalog idea" — done.
**Then built the operator's first-three-in-order, each TDD + independent codex-GPT-5.5 gate, subagent-recon-first:**
- **#1 onboarding-exclude** (`0c8a3de`): generalized `ensureGitExclude` → `.autodev/`+`.serena/` (per-entry idempotent);
  new standalone `mainTreeStatus` (git.ts) + optional conductor dep → best-effort dirty-tree **preflight** WARN at
  `run()` start with a skip-worktree hint for TRACKED churn files (exclude only fixes UNtracked). codex: shell-footgun +
  rename-parse → re-critic CLEAN.
- **#2 relaunch dedup / backlog C** (`61ad0cb`): `isDuplicateTask` = file_set overlap (reuse `fileSetsDisjoint`) AND
  normalized-title, vs pending/active/escalated. Full dup → skip enqueue + re-trigger; partial → enqueue all + WARN
  (never drop a subset → depends_on-safe; fail-open on title drift). codex CLEAN 0 findings. **Backlog C CLOSED.**
- **#3 apply-on-accept** (`d0f9551` + UI `df149ca`): reply **choice "C"** (gate-override; A/B unchanged). Worktree is
  gone at escalation, so it replays `runtime/<id>/diff.patch` (conductor now also pins `runtime/<id>/loop-branch`) via
  `git apply` → add file_set → commit → escalated/→done/ + markDone (legitimate: file_set IS in the repo). Fails CLOSED:
  `--numstat` subset-validation (strict allowlist — `.env`≠`env`; abs/`..` rejected), exact loop-branch pin, clean tree,
  rollback-on-post-apply-failure, loud override commit msg. UI "Commit anyway" + confirmation modal (409 reason in-modal).
  codex found 4 real bugs across 2 rounds (dirty-tree-on-commit-fail, patch-not-scoped, weak branch check, reply-before-move;
  then leading-dot bypass + rollback exit codes) → re-critic CLEAN — the gate earned its keep on a gate-bypass feature.
**Merged** PR #55 (backend, `f26e86a`) + PR #56 (UI, `794ed2d`), CI 4/4 both. 830 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck+build green.
**LIVE-PROVEN (real daemon on `woodev-shipping-plugin-test`, evidence-first):** choice C → real commit `c62a5f4` with the
override marker, task escalated→done; no-diff task → 409 + stays escalated (fail-closed); fresh serena repo → `.serena/`
excluded + tree clean; dirty tree → preflight WARN fired. **#2 dedup left NOT live-proven** (needs 2 expensive opus runs —
deferred to a supervised morning run). Seed cleanup done; test repo left clean on `autodev/main` (HEAD = the proof commit).

---

## s32 (cont'd) — 2026-07-08 — live-proving #2 found a REAL dedup gap → fixed (intent-level dedup, PR #58)

**Operator resumed for the deferred #2 live-prove — and the live run found a real bug the unit tests missed.**
First attempt: launched the same intent twice from the UI. Run 1 escalated `dedup-proof-md` (critic disagreement,
correct). Operator replied "A" on the escalation card BETWEEN the two launches (a UI habit, not instructed) — moving
the task to `quarantine`, which dedup deliberately excludes. Run 2 then decomposed a SECOND task, `dedup-proof-doc`,
same `file_set: [DEDUP-PROOF.md]` but a DIFFERENT title ("verifying relaunch-intent deduplication" vs "verification
note at repo root") — opus re-titles identical work on every decompose. **`isDuplicateTask`'s AND-title-match missed
it: real duplicate, not caught, fail-open.** Root-caused live from `conductor.log` + the queue state, not guessed.
**Fix (operator-chosen, "intent-level dedup"):** compare the OPERATOR's intent text (normalized), not the LLM's
retitled task output — robust to exactly the drift that broke the task-level heuristic. New `caps.read.recentRuns()`
reads `<stateDir>/runs/*.json`; `handleIntent` checks it BEFORE the expensive decompose: same intent + a prior run's
task still pending/active/escalated → skip decompose, enqueue nothing, re-trigger, WARN. Task-level heuristic kept as
a secondary layer (still catches other duplicate shapes). codex gate: Sev-2 (recentRuns read+parsed ALL manifests
before slicing to 50 — unbounded on a large runs dir) + Sev-3 (forged manifest, low-risk trusted-stateDir) → bounded
(filter `run-*.json` → sort → slice 50 BEFORE any read; lstat + 64KB cap per candidate before parse) → **re-critic
CLEAN**. 837 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck green. **Merged PR #58 (`ec9721f`).**
**RE-LIVE-PROVEN clean, same repo, same daemon-restart discipline:** two real orchestrate launches of the IDENTICAL
intent (this time NOT replying to the first escalation) → run 2's log: `"this intent was already orchestrated ...
nothing enqueued -- re-triggering"` in ~30ms (opus decompose skipped) → exactly ONE escalated task afterward, zero
duplicates. **All three s32 backlog items are now live-proven end-to-end.**
**Lesson banked** (operator's standing ask — prove the real goal, evidence-first): a live run surfaced what 6 passing
integration tests (written with controlled identical titles) structurally could not — the tests proved the code did
what the tests said, not that the tests said the right thing. Proportional live-proving on a gate-adjacent feature
(dedup interacts with the escalation/quarantine lifecycle) paid for itself immediately.

---

## s32 (cont'd 2) — 2026-07-08 — "how would I know it was deduped?" → toast fix (PR #60) + orchestrator-CHAT vision parked

**Operator's follow-up question, exactly on point:** after seeing the dedup fix work, "as an operator how was I supposed
to know the run didn't start because of a duplicate? It looked like a silent failure to me." Investigated instead of
assuming: `POST /orchestrate` is fire-and-forget (202 immediately, R1-safe by design); the real outcome is decided in
the background and reported ONLY as a `[orchestrator] [LEVEL]` line in `digest.md`. `NewRunComposer` showed a static
"Run accepted — decomposing intent…" that never updates; `DigestStrip` (the only activity-log surface) lives on
`RunView`, not `Home`; a dedup-skip records no new run manifest, so there's nowhere to click into. **Confirmed
genuinely silent**, not the operator misreading something.
**Fix (PR #60, `c58ad21`):** watch the already-WS-live `digestTail` (reuses the existing `useState(projectId)` query
and the existing WS→invalidate pipeline — zero backend change) for the first NEW `[orchestrator]`-line after a
launch, within a 20s window, toast it (sonner) with a level-mapped variant. While in there, fixed a latent bug in the
never-rendered shadcn `sonner.tsx` scaffold: it read `useTheme` from `next-themes`, a library whose `<ThemeProvider>`
is never mounted in this app (own theme system in `@/lib/theme`) — toast theme would never have tracked the real
light/dark switch; mounted `<Toaster/>` at the app root (existed, never rendered). codex: 1 real bug (toasted the
LATEST orchestrator line instead of the FIRST new one after baseline, in case several land between refetches) → fixed
→ re-critic CLEAN. Review-only UI (no test infra for this UI, established convention); typecheck+build green.
**Live-proven via the real data path** (not synthetic): pulled the actual WARN line from the earlier dedup live-prove
straight out of `digest.md`, confirmed the real `GET /state` serves it in `digestTail`, and ran it through the
EXACT shipped regex → `{level:"WARN", message:"..."}` → would call `toast.warning(...)`. Every stage proven with real
production data; only the DOM paint itself is out of API-reach.
**The bigger reveal:** the operator's actual target isn't a toast — it's a real CONVERSATION with the orchestrator on
launch ("we discussed this since early design"). Today's `handleIntent` is explicitly a one-shot TERMINATING pipeline,
not an agentic loop. This is a genuine architecture pivot, deliberately NOT bundled into this wrap-up — parked in
`FUTURE-BACKLOG.md` "Orchestrator CHAT" with the key open question flagged up front: does a live conversational
orchestrator conflict with `adr/003`'s accepted role split ("gate/enforcement stays deterministic, an LLM can't talk
past it")? **Next session opens with that brainstorm**, per operator instruction, PLUS scoping a NEW pivot candidate
the operator found: `github.com/redwoodjs/agent-ci` + `agent-ci.dev/blog/the-agentic-dev-loop` — recon-first against
our 5-way frame (same discipline as the agency-agents pivot) before judging nice-to-have vs YAGNI vs must-have.
Session saved; see `next-session-promt.md` (gitignored) for the full handoff.

## s31 — 2026-07-07 — Three stuck-task / runs-UI bug fixes (PR #54) + harness PROVEN end-to-end (first green DONE)

**Trigger:** operator's live SMOKE run "stuck in ACTIVE ~30 min", not escalating/quarantining. Systematic-debugging.
**Bug 1 (root cause of the report):** gate said COMMIT, worker committed to the worktree branch, but `mergeAfterGate`
refused the merge-back into `autodev/main` because the test repo's MAIN tree was dirty — and it **threw** on that
precondition instead of returning `{ok:false}`, so the conductor's graceful `if(!mr.ok)` escalation was bypassed, the
throw unwound through `finally` (teardown ran → no daemon children), and the API orchestrate handler only logged it →
task **orphaned in `active/`** forever, `file_set` silently locking future runs. Fix `ec8394c`: `mergeAfterGate` returns
`{ok:false,reason}` on the dirty-tree + failed-checkout preconditions; conductor escalates with the accurate cause
(conflict vs precondition); **defense-in-depth backstop** catches ANY unhandled throw in `runIteration` → `escalated/`
(resolve-not-reject); post-commit `markDone`/`appendDigest` made best-effort. codex CHANGES-REQUIRED (Sev-1: a throw
after `moveTask→done` would mis-escalate a committed task) → fixed → re-critic CLEAN. Live-proven.
**Bug 2 (operator found next — "stuck in PENDING"):** relaunching left a task in PENDING with nothing consuming it =
backlog B. Root cause: orchestrate triggers a bounded run sized to its batch (`maxIterations=specs.length`) but
`claimNextTask` claims from the GLOBAL pending pool → a pre-existing pending task (my cleanup residue) ate the single
iteration and the batch's own task stranded; `serve` has no continuous drain. Fix `9e3157d`: `drain` run mode (stop on
idle OR rate-limit); orchestrator triggers `{drain:true}` → one launch clears the whole pool. codex CHANGES-REQUIRED
(persistent-429 could hold the single-flight lock to maxSessionHours) → drain also stops on rate-limit → re-critic
CLEAN. Live-proven: 2 pending tasks BOTH drained. **Backlog B CLOSED.**
**"0 in DONE, everything escalates" (operator pushed hard):** proved the harness had never landed a DONE. Not a code
bug — three stacked blockers: (a) test repo main tree perma-dirty (42 files); (b) **`.serena/project.yml` is TRACKED and
Serena auto-rewrites it → re-dirties the tree mid-run** → merge refused (new gotcha); (c) my proof/smoke-named intents
tripped the critic's fabricated-proof heuristic (correct). Cleaned tree (`reset --hard`+`clean`; removed Windows reserved
`nul` via `\\?\` long-path; `--skip-worktree` on tracked `.serena`) + a LEGITIMATE doc intent → **worker → critic clean →
gate COMMIT → merge → DONE**, real commit `a7b9f7b` on `autodev/main`. First end-to-end green DONE.
**Bug 3 (operator found — HomeView "No runs yet" despite a DONE):** `GET /runs` returned `[]`; every manifest "skipped
as unreadable/invalid". Root cause: run ids keep `.` from the intent slug (`slugifyIntent`/`isPathSafeId` allow it) but
the read side (`isRunManifest` + `/runs/:id[/usage]`+PATCH) validated with the stricter dot-free `safeIdSegment` → all
filename-derived runs dropped. Fix `a1c81d2`: reuse `isPathSafeId` as the run-id read validator (`safeRunId`); task/
escalation ids stay strict; traversal-safe. codex CLEAN. Live-verified `/runs` returns 8 (was 0).
**Merge:** PR #54 (merge-commit `3a0c641`, CI 4/4), all 3 commits preserved, main resynced. 798 tests / 3 skip.
**New gotchas (2, count 44→46):** `[env/serena-churn-blocks-merge]`, `[api/run-id-dot-validation-mismatch]`.
**Backlog captured:** onboarding should git-exclude `.serena/`+`.autodev/` by default (operator ask).
**Process notes:** a background CI poller using `jq` silently spun forever (jq not on this Git-Bash) → use `gh pr checks`
text parsing. The auto-mode classifier blocked `gh pr merge` until the operator's explicit in-session "домержить" (same
mechanical gate as s24). Test repo `woodev-shipping-plugin-test` is fully disposable (operator: "do whatever").
**Next session = PIVOT:** study `github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents` (operator's "competitor") — see `next-session-promt.md`.

## s30 — 2026-07-07 — Onboarding redesign (any-folder + auto git-init/branch + git-not-installed) — brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent build

**Trigger:** operator flagged the New Project flow: it only lets you pick folders that are already git repos (the browser
scans for `.git`, non-git folders unpickable). He wanted a standard OS folder dialog + auto `git init` + a git-not-installed
notice. **Brainstormed:** a browser web UI CANNOT get a native folder path (sandbox); a daemon-spawned native dialog is
fragile on Windows and still needs the in-browser fallback → operator agreed to KEEP the in-browser browser and instead
drop the git-only filter, add an inline **init git**, hide system/hidden dirs, and add a git-not-installed banner. Native
dialog deferred to the desktop wrap. Spec + plan written & committed (`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-07-onboarding-redesign*`).

- **Execution:** subagent-driven, Sonnet 5 workers in coherent units (util/git verbs+ensure-branch → fsbrowse+detect-git →
  admin+server+index) → **codex GPT-5.5 gate over the whole backend** → UI (review-only). 11 tasks, TDD.
- **The s30 Task 1 branch-guard bug is FIXED here** as the shared `ensureAutodevBranch`/`initAutodevRepo`
  (`src/util/ensure-branch.ts`): put a repo on `^autodev/` (no-op if matching / switch to existing / else create the fixed
  `autodev/main`). Wired on register AND a defensive best-effort daemon-startup pass over every registered project.
- **New:** `Git` verbs (`init`/`listBranches`/`checkout`/`createBranch`/`commitEmpty`/`countUntracked`); `admin.initGit`
  (`git init` → empty bootstrap commit → autodev branch; existing files stay UNTRACKED, returns `untrackedCount`); dropped
  the `not_a_git_repo` register gate; `POST /fs/git-init` + `GET /system/git`; fsbrowse hides dot/`$`/system dirs;
  `detectGit` PATH probe. UI: any-folder select + inline init git + git-not-installed banner ("Install it now" → git-scm.com).
- **codex gate:** CHANGES-REQUIRED — 3 Medium + 2 Low. Fixed: (M1) `register` now SURFACES a branch-ensure failure as a
  typed `branch_ensure_failed` (no swallow, no registry append) instead of persisting a broken registration — also resolves
  (M2) the unborn-HEAD case (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` exits 128 on a zero-commit repo → `currentBranch` throws →
  surfaced); (M3) `initGit` rejects a path INSIDE an existing work tree (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`), not just a
  direct `.git`; (L) 2 test-quality fixes. **Re-critic: CLEAN.**
- **Verification:** 790 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck+build green. **Backend LIVE-PROVEN via curl** on a scratch
  registry: `/system/git` (git 2.49), git-init a non-git folder → `autodev/main` + 2 untracked + empty commit, 409 on
  re-init and on a subdir-inside-worktree, hidden-dir filter, register, and **startup ensure switched a project
  `main`→`autodev/main` (switched to existing, not recreated)**. UI builds; operator to visually verify the New Project
  screen before merge. Env wrinkle: root `build:ui` runs `npm --prefix ui ci` which hit a locked native `lightningcss.node`
  (antivirus/handle) → use `cd ui && npm run build` (or `npm install` to reconcile) — not a code defect.
- **MERGED via PR #53** (merge-commit, NOT squash — it also carried the whole s29 shadcn migration, which was only merged
  LOCALLY in s29 and rode this PR per the s29 handoff; squash would have blobbed 2 sessions). **CI green 4/4** (ubuntu+windows
  × node 20/22). main tip `f51d5d9`. 1 new gotcha (init-leaves-untracked/branch-autoswitch).
- **Live run-test (operator).** After fixing his 404 (STALE daemon — old process served fresh dist/ui files but old
  in-memory routing, so `/fs/git-init` 404'd `[build/stale-dist-backend]`; kill+restart fixed it), he ran a real
  orchestrate: pipeline launched cleanly off `autodev/main` (**branch fix CONFIRMED e2e**), worker wrote the file, but
  codex critic returned `broken` (0.62) — the SMOKE INTENT TEXT contained a non-ASCII em-dash `—`, flagged as a
  documentation/encoding contract concern. Correct gate behavior, not a code bug (my test wording). Operator hit A(accept)
  → task → **quarantine, NOT committed** (accept has no apply-on-commit; s26 `[escalate/replied-holds-filelock]`). An
  ASCII-only intent would commit cleanly. → FUTURE-BACKLOG "apply-on-accept".
- **Still open (out of scope):** (B) orphaned PENDING tasks (enqueue-before-guard) and (C) intent dedup. Minor: 3 corrupt
  run-manifest json spam daemon.log WARNs (harmless).

## s29 — 2026-07-06 — Full UI migration to shadcn (Base UI, zinc) — brainstorm → spec → plan → build (autonomous)

**Trigger:** operator noticed our UI only used shadcn's *foundation idiom* (Tailwind+CVA+cn+lucide), not shadcn
components — no `components.json`, no Radix/Base UI. Decision (brainstormed + AskUserQuestion): move the whole `ui/`
to the **default shadcn look on Base UI (zinc), IBM Plex fonts kept, incremental per-screen gated PRs.** New durable
rule recorded: **shadcn-first** (verify shadcn has no equivalent before writing/keeping custom UI) → `AGENTS.md` + memory.

- **Spec + plan** written to `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-06-shadcn-ui-migration*.md`, committed.
- **Execution:** subagent-driven (Sonnet 5 workers) + **mandatory codex GPT-5.5 critic every phase** (operator granted
  overnight autonomy; merged after critic-clean + green build/typecheck, no per-merge approval).
- **PR0 foundation** (`shadcn init` Base UI/zinc, reconciled theme, `.dark`, 17 primitives, signature-preserving
  Button/Card/TabBar/StatusPill/Dot/Feedback). Critic caught the **muted/accent token-alias collision** (legacy aliases
  hijacked shadcn's reserved names with inverted meaning) + TabBar accent — fixed, re-critic clean.
- **PR1 shell** (DropdownMenu), **PR2 board**, **PR3 run** (VerdictSeal→Badge+Progress+muted composition, new
  `textarea.tsx`, DiffView stays custom), **PR4 task detail**, **PR5 settings+onboarding** (SettingsPopover→Popover,
  gear rewired as the real trigger to fix a toggle regression) — each codex-gated; findings fixed + re-critic each time.
- **Final cleanup:** legacy-token alias layer retired; only status vars (`--color-working/uncertain/broken/clean`) stay.
- **Recurring critic finds (→ gotchas):** zinc light `--card`==`--background`==white & dark `--sidebar`==`--card`
  (layers need borders or `bg-muted`); `text-white` hovers break in light; PR0's `text-muted` sed missed inline
  `var(--color-muted)`-as-text. **Verified: 766 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck + build green.**
- **NOT done during build:** live browser visual proof (browser tooling was down) — left for the operator.

**Post-migration live check (same session, operator at the machine):**
- **UI visually live-verified** by the operator on a real `serve` (`node dist/index.js serve` → `:4319/`, which serves
  the built `dist/ui` directly — no vite needed). Browser-verify item CLOSED. Also diagnosed the operator's "daemon
  won't start" — they ran the bare binary (defaults to conductor `run`, guarded off `main`); the fix is the `serve` verb.
- **Found 3 onboarding/runner bugs (→ s30):** (A) **branch guard** — a fresh project's first run enqueues then dies on
  `conductor: refusing to run on branch 'master'` because the New Project scaffold (`src/registry/scaffold.ts`) never
  switches the repo to an `^autodev/` branch (guard at `conductor.ts:517`, default pattern `^autodev/` `schema.ts:45`).
  Operator wants the scaffold/startup to auto-create+switch to `autodev/*`. (B) **orphaned tasks** — enqueue happens
  before the guard, so a guard-failed run leaves the task stuck in PENDING. (C) **no dedup** — relaunching the same
  intent stacks duplicate tasks; want an equivalent-task-already-pending guard. Cleaned the 2 orphaned smoke tasks from
  the test project's queue. **s30 plan: fix A first (codex-gated) → operator live-verifies → then B/C, then resume.**
- **UX note (operator):** the composer is fire-and-forget ("Run accepted" → silence); operator expects more
  transcript-forward feedback (matches the earlier desktop-IA discussion) — candidate: auto-open Run view on launch /
  inline status stream. Parked in the deferred UI-polish bucket.

## s28 — 2026-07-06 — Agent extensions: worker isolation + always-on critic NO-TOOLS preamble + live visibility scan (PR #51)

**Web-UI item (4) rescoped from "attach skills/plugins/MCP" to "visibility + isolation" after an empirical investigation,
then built in 3 modules (both backend ones independently codex GPT-5.5-gated).**

- **Opener = INVESTIGATION (operator's s27 steer), not a build.** Explore recon + **two live `claude -p` probes** proved
  the spawned worker + critic child CLIs already INHERIT the operator's full ambient extensions (global `~/.claude`/
  `~/.codex` + project config): env passthrough, worker cwd = git worktree, `-p`/`exec` load MCP+skills+plugins+subagents+
  hooks at runtime (bare cwd → 9 MCP / 46 skills / 78 slash / 17 plugins / 11 agents + hook). So "attach" is redundant.
  **Reported → decided WITH operator:** build visibility + isolation. Flag-semantics probe (C) found the flags are NOT
  orthogonal (`--bare` = clean-room, subsumes MCP+skills; init `plugins` count = installed-not-active).
- **M1a (codex merge-clean, `34c83f4`):** config `isolation.worker.{cleanRoom,mcp,skills}` (OFF by default → byte-identical
  spawn); `workerIsolationFlags` (cleanRoom→`--bare`, mcp→`--strict-mcp-config`, skills→`--disable-slash-commands`) appended
  to worker args; **always-on NO-TOOLS preamble in `buildCriticPrompt`** (closes docs-vs-code gap); projection + write path.
- **M1b (codex 1 Medium + 1 Low fixed → re-critic clean, `62307c7`):** `GET /projects/:id/agent-extensions` streams the
  real worker CLI, captures `system/init`, kills before any model turn (zero token cost); thin `onScanExtensions?`
  capability. Fixes: `MAX_REMAINDER_BYTES` buffer cap; streaming-spawner try/catch (never-reject). Low endpoint-guard
  DECLINED (consistent w/ `handleDetectAgents`; global `.catch` backstop).
- **M2 (review-only, `7b7e773`):** Isolation toggles (Clean-room master greys MCP/Skills) + live-scan panel (MCP status
  pills / skills / slash / agents). Wired into `buildDiff` send-only-changed.
- **Verification:** 766 tests / 3 skip, root+ui typecheck + build green. **LIVE-PROVEN** (Playwright + curl): scan returned
  9/46/78/11; PATCH cleanRoom=true → re-scan **0/14/33/3** (matches the `--bare` probe); UI states + Clean-room greying
  proven; screenshots to operator. 2 new gotchas (40 `[agents/inherit-ambient-extensions]`, 41
  `[detect/isolation-flags-not-orthogonal]`). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-agent-extensions-isolation.md`.

## s27 (B) — 2026-07-06 — Plan checklist in the session rail (operator ask) (PR #49 `e485c36`)

**Second s27 module — an operator ask raised mid-session:** after a plan is written, show the plan todo list in the right
sidebar as a checklist. Recon-first, review-only UI, no backend, live-proven.

- **Recon** (Explore) mapped `SessionRail.tsx` (the Now/Queue/Session/Roles/Tokens `Block`s), the run→tasks link
  (`RunManifest.taskIds` IS the ordered plan; tasks carry no `run_id`, status = the queue they sit in), the `useTaskIndex`
  join, and the `QUEUE_META`/`StatusPill`/`Dot` primitives. **No new backend** — `useRuns`+`useTaskIndex` (over
  `/runs`+`/state`, both WS-invalidated) fully supply ordered ids + live per-task status.
- **UI (review-only, Sonnet worker):** new `<Block title="Plan">` after "Now": newest run (`runs[0]`, matching
  `useSessionUsage`) → its `taskIds` as a live checklist. Row = status glyph + truncated title (native tooltip); `Block`
  header carries a `done/total` badge; a truncated plan label (`name ?? intent`) sits under it. Glyph map (reuse
  `QUEUE_META` tones): done→`Check`(clean), pending→`Square`(idle), active→pulsing working dot, escalated→uncertain dot,
  quarantine→broken dot, unresolved id→muted idle dot (mirrors RunView's "not in any queue" fallback so length==plan).
  "no plan yet" empty/loading state.
- **Verification:** typecheck clean (root+ui), build:ui green, CI 4/4. **LIVE-PROVEN** on a seeded run (4 tasks across
  done/active/pending/escalated) → rail rendered **Plan · 1/4** with correct per-status glyphs + label. Screenshot to
  operator. Self-merged. Follow-up (not blocking): active & escalated both render amber-family dots (inherited Board
  palette — working/uncertain are close); a per-row status label or distinct escalated/quarantine icons would sharpen them.

## s27 (A) — 2026-07-06 — Role-matrix editor: role cards + planner/heterogeneity config projection (web-UI item 3) (PR #48 `b8ebce6`)

**s27 opener — web-UI pilot→product item 3.** Layout discussed WITH the operator (his zone) BEFORE building: chose
**cards** (not a grid), planner **optional** with orchestrator-fallback, heterogeneity warning **surfaced honestly from
the backend**. Recon → codex-gated backend → review-only UI → live-proof.

- **Recon** (Explore) mapped `src/config/roles.ts` (roles registry, `heterogeneityWarnings`, `adapterMeta`,
  `assertKnownAdapters`), the config projection (`ProjectConfigView` + `src/index.ts` populate + GET handler),
  `ScaffoldFormSchema`, and the existing `ProjectSettingsView` roles section + `SelectOrCustomRow` + `buildDiff`. Flagged:
  planner is nowhere in the projection/write-schema; `policy.heterogeneity` + warnings are server-internal (logged only).
- **Backend (codex-gated `93928af`, Opus worker, TDD):** `ProjectConfigView` gains `roles.planner?` (projected ONLY when
  the operator explicitly set `roles.planner` in the RAW config — new `loadConfigWithRaw` returns `{cfg, raw}` with NO
  second read; `loadConfig` delegates; `isPlannerExplicitlyConfigured(raw)` gates it since the parsed cfg always defaults
  planner), `policy.heterogeneity` (read-only) + `heterogeneityWarnings[]` (reuses the existing `heterogeneityWarnings(cfg)`
  — respects `off`). `ScaffoldFormSchema` accepts `roles.planner.{adapter,model,effort}` (strict, mirrors orchestrator;
  wired through `buildConfigYaml`+`mergeConfigYaml`, preserves hand-set fields). Pure `buildProjectConfigView` extracted to
  `src/api/config-view.ts`. No runtime planner routing (reserved). **codex GPT-5.5 gate: merge-clean, 0 findings.**
- **UI (review-only `61c5d4c`, Opus worker):** roles → 4 role cards; reuse s26 `SelectOrCustomRow`/`EditableList` +
  detected-agents catalog. Planner OPTIONAL: read-unset→dimmed "not set · orchestrator handles planning";
  edit-unset→"+ Configure planner" (seeds claude/sonnet, `addPlanner` intent flag ensures `buildDiff` never emits planner
  unless added); configured→editable. Heterogeneity warn badge on the critic card + verbatim strip (reuses
  `--color-uncertain` amber token). `buildDiff` send-only-changed contract preserved (planner uses the same `addIfChanged`).
- **Verification:** 737 tests / 3 skip, typecheck clean (root+ui), CI 4/4. **LIVE-PROVEN** on a real serve: read/edit
  cards, detection-backed dropdowns (Claude Code/Codex CLI/GPT-5.5/effort), the FULL planner round-trip
  (unset→"+ Configure planner"→Save→`roles.planner` written to config.yaml→projection includes planner via the raw-presence
  gate→"claude · sonnet" read card). Screenshots to operator.
- **New gotcha `[ui/heterogeneity-badge-forward-looking]` (39):** the badge can't fire on a currently-valid config —
  `assertKnownAdapters` forces worker=claude/critic=codex (families always differ) so `heterogeneityWarnings` is always
  `[]` and a same-family config never loads. Deliberate forward-looking insurance (lights up when the adapter allowlist
  widens); data path proven by `config-view.test.ts`, not a live serve. Also parked two operator asks in `FUTURE-BACKLOG.md`
  (docs commit `e7361b2` rode PR #48): per-field help tooltips/modals (EARLY) + i18n Russian UI (LATE).

---

## s26 (B) — 2026-07-05 — PATH-scan auto-detect of installed CLI agents (web-UI pilot→product slice 1) (PR #47)

**Second module of s26 — the operator's web-UI pilot→product track opens.** Recon-first (Open Design donor), operator
UX gate (Settings dropdowns + a Global "Installed agents" panel; add ollama + kilocode), then a codex-gated backend +
review-only UI, browser-live-proven.

- **Recon** (subagent) mapped Open Design's detection (`references/open-design`): hardcoded registry + pure `existsSync`
  PATHEXT walk (not `which`), `execFile` version probe, static + live model catalogs, per-agent `reasoningOptions`, SSE.
  Our constraints: only claude/codex are live adapters; `cross-spawn` already owns spawn-time PATHEXT, so detection is a
  SEPARATE read-only probe; the UI seam mirrors `GET /fs/dirs`.
- **M1 backend (codex-gated, `c9418d2`)**: pure `src/detect/detect-agents.ts` — curated catalog (2 supported + 7
  display-only incl. ollama/kilocode), PATHEXT-aware **executable** probe (`isFile` + POSIX `X_OK`, not bare `existsSync`),
  best-effort version; `GET /agents/detect` daemon-global via the admin port; `runNative` opt-in `timeoutMs`
  (SIGTERM→SIGKILL, default unset = existing callers untouched).
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 3 rounds → CLEAN**: R1 1 High (probe timeout leaked the child — `withTimeout` resolved null but
  never killed) + 2 Medium (`existsSync` reports dirs/non-exec as installed; win32 PATHEXT test non-portable on
  case-sensitive CI) + 1 Low (relative PATH → non-absolute path). Fixed: `runNative` kill deadline; `isExecutableFile`;
  `codex.CMD` test; `path.resolve`. R2 flagged the kill only sent SIGTERM (ignorable) → escalated to SIGKILL after a grace
  period + a SIGTERM-trapping test. R3 CLEAN (safe to merge).
- **M2 UI (review-only, `0a2b7f4`)**: Global Settings "Installed agents" panel (status pill + version + supported tag +
  install link + Rescan); Project Settings adapter/model/effort **dropdowns** (`SelectOrCustomRow` with a Custom… escape
  hatch; effort row hidden for no-effort adapters like claude; worker ladder unchanged; `buildDiff` untouched — both modes
  write the same draft string; falls back to free-text on detection failure).
- **Verification**: 712 tests / 3 skipped, typecheck+build green (root+ui). **LIVE-PROVEN** on a real serve: endpoint
  returned claude (`claude.EXE`) + codex (`codex.CMD` — the PATHEXT shim was resolved, the whole point) supported with
  versions; ollama/kilocode/opencode/cursor-agent/qwen detected display-only; gemini/aider not-detected. Both UI surfaces
  rendered correctly in the browser (screenshots to operator). Daemon + scratch seed torn down.
- New gotcha `[detect/executable-probe]` (38). Branch `autodev/s26-agent-autodetect`.

## s26 — 2026-07-05 — fix the replied-escalation file-lock (s26 opener, variant 1)

**The operator-chosen s26 opener — a real correctness/UX bug found live in s25** (`[escalate/replied-holds-filelock]`,
gotcha 37). A replied escalation was left in `queue/escalated/`, where its `file_set` silently blocked every future
run on the same file(s) (`claimNextTask` locks on `active`+`escalated` alike) with no operator signal.

- **Recon-first** (Explore subagent): mapped `handleReply` (`src/api/server.ts`) ↔ `parseEscalation`/reply-write
  (`src/escalate/escalate.ts`) ↔ the scheduler lock (`claimNextTask`, `const locked = [...active, ...escalated]`) ↔
  the single transition helper `repo.moveTask` (atomic `fs.rename`). Confirmed: escalation id === task id; `escalated`
  is effectively terminal — nothing in the codebase ever moved a task OUT of it.
- **Fix (TDD, Sonnet worker):** `handleReply` now transitions the replied task out of `escalated/` after writing the
  reply file — **B (rework) → `pending`** (re-queue), **A (accept) → `quarantine`**. ENOENT tolerated (drift-* has no
  queue file; double-reply) → 200; other move errors → 500 (surface a still-held lock, never silent-200).
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 1 High + 1 Medium → fixed → re-critic CLEAN.** High: the first cut used **A → `done`**, which
  falsely satisfies a dependent's `depends_on` (`doneIds`) on work that was NEVER committed (the gate escalated
  *instead of* committing; there is no apply-on-accept machinery). **Operator decision: A → `quarantine`** — releases
  the file-lock without claiming repo-completion (quarantine is neither in the lock set nor in `doneIds`). Medium:
  added a dependency-safety regression test (a dependent stays blocked after an A reply). Re-critic: safe to merge.
- **Verification.** 693 tests (+5) / 2 skip, typecheck green (root+ui). The regression tests run the REAL
  `FileBlackboardRepository` + REAL `createScheduler` over a REAL HTTP server (`createApiServer` + `listen(0)` + `fetch`):
  a replied escalation leaves `escalated/`, unblocks a same-`file_set` pending task, and does NOT falsely satisfy a
  dependent. Real serve wiring (`src/index.ts:150` `view: { repo: root.repo }`) statically confirmed → `p.repo.moveTask`
  works at runtime, not just under the test fake. Proportional: no expensive aurora live-run (the integration test already
  exercises the exact HTTP→repo→scheduler path; no UI surface changed).
- **codex operational gotcha captured** (added to `[critic/codex]`): a background codex run can STALL trying to spawn its
  own plugins/skills in the blocked Windows sandbox and get killed before emitting a verdict (happened twice) — prepend a
  hard NO-TOOLS preamble + run foreground; with the diff inline codex answers in one turn.
- Branch `autodev/s26-escalation-filelock`, fix commit `d5738d4`. PR + self-merge (machine bar + green CI).

## s25 — 2026-07-05 — UI cross-run token view (this run/today/all-time) + strip cost from telemetry (PR #45 `c4fae71`)

**The recommended s24 opener — first consumer of the s24 server-side aggregate `GET /runs/:id/usage`, plus the
operator's "token count only, NO cost" cleanup.** Backend codex-gated; UI review-only.

- **UI (review-only).** SessionRail **Tokens** block now shows three rows — **this run / today / all-time** — via one
  `useSessionUsage` hook: fetch the runs list once, call `getRunUsage` per run, bucket in a SINGLE pass (`thisRun` =
  newest run, `today` = runs whose manifest `at` is in the local calendar day, `allTime` = every non-archived run).
  This RETIRES the s22 client-side N×M `useRunUsage` walk (one call per run, not per task). New `api.ts` server
  `RunUsageSummary` type + `getRunUsage` client method; `SessionUsage` shape in `queries.ts`.
- **Strip cost end-to-end (backend, codex-gated — touches the conductor artifact + endpoint).** Operator directive
  (s24 end, memory `[[feedback-usage-tokens-not-cost]]`): TOKEN COUNT only, no `$` anywhere. Removed `total_cost_usd`/
  `cost` from `WorkerUsage`, `TokenUsageDoc` (nested + top-level), `parseClaudeUsage`, `buildTokenUsageDoc`,
  `RunUsageSummary`, `buildRunUsageSummary`, `isTokenUsageDoc`, and the UI mirrors (`api.ts` `TokenUsageDoc`,
  `queries.ts`, `SessionRail` `formatCost`). **Backward-compatible**: a legacy `token-usage.json` still carrying
  `total_cost_usd` validates and contributes its tokens (never its cost) — `isTokenUsageDoc` ignores the extra field.
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 1 Medium + 1 Low → fixed → re-critic CLEAN.** Medium: `buildTokenUsageDoc` persisted
  `worker.runs` by REFERENCE — dropping the field from the *type* does not strip it from a *runtime* object handed in,
  and `JSON.stringify` serializes the real shape → a stray cost could leak into the written artifact. No active trigger
  (the sole `WorkerUsage` constructor `parseClaudeUsage` is cost-free), but at a persisted-artifact write boundary under
  a "no cost anywhere" contract, the defense is cheap and makes the guarantee STRUCTURAL. Fixed: rebuild worker+critic
  per-run arrays as token-only copies at the write boundary + regression test asserting `JSON.stringify(doc)` carries no
  `/cost/i`. New gotcha `[usage/type-strip-not-runtime-strip]` (36).
- **Verification.** 688 tests (+2 skipped), typecheck green (root+ui), both bundles rebuilt. **Live-smoke** on a seeded
  2-run project (run-a today / run-b 2 days ago): endpoint curl-proved (`run-a` tokens=120 with **no `cost` field**;
  `run-b`=100; the legacy-with-cost task counted token-only) → rail rendered **this run 120 / today 120 / all-time 220**
  (older run correctly excluded from today, included in all-time). Screenshot sent; seed + daemon torn down.
- main tip = `c4fae71` (PR #45 squash — folded in the two unpushed s24 docs commits `0860506`+`4cf7ed9` per batch-merges).
  This session-save docs commit rides the next PR. Working tree clean.

**Live token-run demo + bug find (post-merge, operator-driven).** Served the daemon on aurora's REAL state and the
operator drove a fresh `orchestrate` from the UI to see live tokens. Outcome: worker (sonnet) → `php -l` gate → **codex
critic `clean` 0.98** → **COMMIT `9b373aa`**; `token-usage.json` written with real worker usage (**531,533 tokens**) and
**no `cost` field** — the s25 strip proven on a live run; rail rendered this run/today/all-time = 531.5k; s24's persisted
`critic-verdict.json` also exercised (real seal). **Bug surfaced live → gotcha `[escalate/replied-holds-filelock]` (37):**
the run first would NOT start — decompose+enqueue OK but the task sat in pending, worker never ran, `conductor.log`
silent, `--once` a 0-second no-op. Root cause = a replied-but-uncleared escalation (`docs-llmfactory-classdoc-v2`, s14)
still in `queue/escalated/` held its `file_set`, and `claimNextTask` locks on `escalated` exactly like `active`, so every
same-file run was silently blocked with no operator signal. Unblocked by moving the resolved escalation → `done`
(operator-approved). **This is the s26 opener (variant 1):** the reply-apply path must move `escalated → done` (accepted)
or re-queue `→ pending` (redo). **Operator UI/UX steer:** the dashboard is a PILOT, not final — PATH auto-detect of
installed CLIs, preset model/effort pickers, richer role matrix, skills/plugins/MCP surface are unbuilt; **polish the web
UI to a real product BEFORE the desktop wrap → desktop DEFERRED** (`FUTURE-BACKLOG.md` "Web UI: pilot → product"). Demo
daemon + scratch registry torn down; aurora left on disposable branch `autodev/s25-token-demo`.

## s24 — 2026-07-04 — TWO modules: critic-verdict.json persistence (PR #43 `b9b87f9`) + server-side run usage aggregation (PR #44 `8067022`)

**Module 2 — server-side per-run usage aggregation `GET /projects/:id/runs/:runId/usage` (PR #44 `8067022`).** Operator
picked NEXT-ACTIONS candidate (b). s22 aggregated token usage client-side per open run only; a cross-run "today" total
would need N×M client fetches, so this adds the clean server path. Pure `buildRunUsageSummary(docs, taskCount)` +
`isTokenUsageDoc` guard in `src/usage/usage.ts` (`num()`-coerced sum; boundary validation skips non-usage JSON);
`handleGetRunUsage` + route in `server.ts` REUSING the existing TOCTOU-hardened readers (`readBoundedManifest` +
`readBoundedFileText`) — no new file-reading security code. Returns `{tokens, cost, any, taskCount, tasksWithUsage}`.
**codex gate — 3 findings:** Medium duplicate-id double-count → FIXED (dedupe + drop path-unsafe ids up front,
`taskCount` = unique-safe) + regression; Low `Promise.all`-rejects-on-throw → FIXED (per-task body wrapped → returns
`TokenUsageDoc|null`, filtered = best-effort by construction); Low nondeterministic sum order → FIXED by the same change
(manifest order). **Re-critic residual:** case-insensitive-fs path-alias double-count (`["t1","T1"]`) → DECLINED with
rationale (orchestrator ids unique + never case-variant; such tasks can't coexist on a case-insensitive fs; bounded
read-only display over-count; a portable case-fold would wrongly merge distinct ids on Linux/CI) — documented in the
handler as an accepted residual. 684 tests, typecheck green, live curl-proof (`tokens:5000 cost:0.08 taskCount:2`).
No UI consumer yet (a "today" view is the follow-on) — the endpoint is the deliverable per the operator's scope.

**Module 1 — critic-verdict.json persistence + committed-task verdict seal (PR #43 `b9b87f9`).**

The recommended s24 opener — closes gotcha `[ui/verdict-not-persisted]`. A CLEAN-committed task never escalates, so its
critic verdict survived only as a `digest.md` line; the dashboard's "verdict first-class" was rich only on escalation.
Since the conductor already writes per-task JSON runtime artifacts (s22 `token-usage.json`), a sibling
`critic-verdict.json` was the natural, well-scoped next module. Full sonnet-TDD → spec-check → codex-gate → re-critic.
- **Backend (codex-gated, enforcement-adjacent).** Pure `buildCriticVerdictDoc` + `CriticVerdictDoc` in
  `src/critic/verdict.ts` (exactOptional-safe `diff_sha256` omission). Best-effort/never-throws `persistCriticVerdict`
  closure in the conductor, written ONLY at a task's DECISIVE point (before the clean `break`, and in the escalate
  branch guarded `if (cr.verdict)`) — never on intermediate retry rounds. Same never-throws contract as
  `persistTokenUsage` (`safeLog`, `[ts/fail-closed]`); served unchanged by the runtime-file endpoint (no new API code).
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 3 findings.** (1) Medium: the FIRST cut persisted every round → a `parseable→retry→null→
  escalate` sequence left a STALE earlier verdict on disk → FIXED via decisive-only placement (intermediate rounds
  never write; a valueless final round leaves no artifact) + a regression test. (2) Medium: extra `clock.now()` not
  "purely observational" → DECLINED with rationale (prod clock is side-effect-free; identical to the already-gated s22
  `persistTokenUsage`; the parity #9 `nowCalls` 3→4 shift crosses NO decision boundary — graceful exit preserved).
  (3) Low: no throwing-logger test → ADDED (writeRuntimeFile throws AND logger throws → clean task still commits).
  **Re-critic: behavior/control-flow CLEAN**; one residual doc-comment ("each round") corrected.
- **UI (review-only, browser-proven).** `CriticVerdictDoc` type + 404-tolerant `useTaskVerdict` hook (mirrors
  `useRunUsage`). Inspector `VerdictTab` prefers the REAL persisted verdict (confidence + notes + broken_contracts via
  the reused `VerdictSeal`) over the state-synthesized placeholder; falls back to synthesis for undecided/pre-s24 tasks.
- **Verification.** 671 tests (+9), typecheck green (root+ui), CI 4/4. **Browser-smoke** on a seeded scratchpad serve:
  the Verdict tab of a committed task rendered `clean` + confidence `0.92` + the persisted notes (vs the old fabricated
  "Critic returned clean; committed & merged." with no confidence). Screenshot sent; seed + daemon torn down.
- **Merge friction.** The auto-mode classifier BLOCKED the self-merge (it discounts the standing memory/CLAUDE.md
  autonomous-merge grant, wanting an explicit in-session OK). Surfaced to the operator (not a design fork — a mechanical
  gate); he replied "мёржи" → squash-merged. Consider a `.claude/settings.json` `Bash(gh pr merge:*)` rule to avoid the
  stop next time (operator's call).
- 1 new gotcha `[conductor/per-round-overwrite-stale]` (34→35). main tip = `b9b87f9`; this docs commit rides the next PR.

**Candidate (c) — codex critic `--json` — ASSESSED & DECLINED (operator agreed).** After the two modules, reconned (c)
before building. Finding: the verdict's authoritative source is the `-o` outfile, but stdout is the FALLBACK
(`parseVerdict` outermost-braces) AND `parseCodexTokens` reads a bare `tokens used` footer — a full `--json` switch
(JSONL event stream) breaks BOTH, and the `--json` event schema is undocumented in-repo (needs an `ADH_LIVE` capture to
design safely). Safe designs both bad-payoff: a separate `--json` spawn doubles critic cost forever, or a single-call
switch bets the gate on unverified CLI behavior — for marginal split+cost telemetry. s22's spec already codified this as
a bad trade. Operator agreed to skip. Recommended cheap next instead: a UI "today" usage view over the new `GET
/runs/:id/usage`. **Workflow snag:** uncommitted docs on the #44 branch were discarded by the post-merge `reset --hard`
and re-applied — commit docs before any reset next time.

---

## s23 — 2026-07-04 — run rename + archive + UI re-run LANDED (PR #42 `53d2ced`)

Second module of the session. Backlog item NEXT ACTIONS #3 (was unscoped) — designed WITH the operator after a
**donor recon** (subagent over AO/OD/OpenHands). The recon reshaped the design decisively.
- **Recon findings.** Rename is donor-unanimous: id immutable + a separate mutable display field (`display_name`/
  `name`/`title`). Archive appears only at AO's CONTAINER (project) level as a `archived_at` soft-flag; the run/session
  unit prefers derived status. **Fork:** AO has none; OD/OpenHands fork a *conversation/event-stream* — which we don't
  have. Our run manifest is a re-derivable index over the blackboard queue, so "fork" ≈ re-orchestrating the intent.
- **Decisions (operator-gated).** Rename + archive as backend verbs; **fork → UI-only "re-run"** (seed the composer,
  no backend fork); archive = reversible `archived_at` soft-flag (no hard-delete). All verbs touch ONLY the manifest.
- **Backend.** `RunManifest` +`name?`/`archived_at?` (`recordRun` unchanged; `isRunManifest` type-validates optionals).
  Pure `applyRunPatch`. `GET /runs?includeArchived=1` (default hides). `PATCH /projects/:id/runs/:runId` — bounded read
  (404 on missing/corrupt) + hardened no-follow write.
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 3 defects over 2 rounds, all fixed → re-critic clean.** (1) HIGH `lstat`→`writeFile` TOCTOU
  followed a symlink swapped in between → replaced with `O_RDWR|O_NOFOLLOW` open + `fstat` + `truncate(0)` +
  `fh.writeFile`. (2) MEDIUM name length checked AFTER `trim`, so 201 spaces passed and CLEARED an existing name →
  raw-length check + regression test. (3) MEDIUM `fh.write` can short-write (ENOSPC/quota/net-FS) → `fh.writeFile`
  (loops). Also: Windows rejects `O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC` without `O_CREAT` (EINVAL) — found empirically, worked around with
  `O_RDWR` + `truncate(0)`, keeping the no-resurrection property (no `O_CREAT`).
- **UI (review-only).** `name ?? intent` on the HomeView card / sidebar / RunView header; RunView actions bar (inline
  rename, archive/unarchive, re-run via a zustand seed store read+cleared by NewRunComposer); HomeView "show archived"
  toggle + muted tag.
- **Verification.** 662 tests (+10 backend), typecheck+build green (root+ui). **Browser-smoke** on a seeded serve drove
  the whole flow live: rename → archive (default list hides) → `?includeArchived` shows → unarchive → re-run (composer
  pre-filled + navigate home) → HomeView show-archived toggle. Screenshot sent; seeded project + daemon torn down.
- **Gotcha caught mid-build (noted in CURRENT-STATE):** a UI-only `build:ui` leaves the served `dist/index.js` STALE —
  a brand-new backend route 404s in the live smoke until a root `npm run build`. Rebuild BOTH before a live smoke.
- Self-merged (machine bar: codex-clean + green CI 4/4). main tip = `53d2ced`. Branch carried the s22 docs commit too.

## s22 — 2026-07-04 — token/usage instrumentation LANDED → the first post-P3 module (PR #41 `675baf0`)

The next real module after P3 closed. Operator scope-gated at session start: **per-task runtime file + client-side
aggregation by run** (minimal conductor touch; the existing generic runtime-file endpoint serves the artifact, so **no
new API code** — the key scope win). Enforcement-adjacent (worker/critic adapters) + conductor → full TDD → spec-check →
independent codex GPT-5.5 gate → re-critic.
- **Backend.** New pure `src/usage/usage.ts`: `parseClaudeUsage` (last stream-json `result` event's `usage`+`total_cost_usd`),
  `parseCodexTokens` (line-anchored bare `tokens used` footer), `buildTokenUsageDoc` aggregator. `WorkerResult.usage?`
  attached in `claude-adapter.toResult`; `CriticResult.usage?` in `codex-adapter` — plain `codex exec` KEPT (not `--json`)
  so the enforcement verdict-resolution path is byte-unchanged; critic yields a single `tokens` total. Conductor
  accumulates worker+critic usage per round → writes `token-usage.json` best-effort/never-throws (`[ts/fail-closed]`,
  same discipline as recordRun/digest/teardown; pushed BEFORE the rate-limit/timeout early-returns so throttled steps
  still account).
- **codex GPT-5.5 gate — 1 Medium.** `parseCodexTokens` first matched "tokens used" ANYWHERE in stdout and grabbed the
  next integer → false telemetry from prose like "No tokens used in this example; finding 3 ...". Fixed = LINE-ANCHORED
  (the whole trimmed line must BE the footer; inline `: N` or a bare-integer next line) + 3 regression tests including
  the exact false-telemetry case. **Re-critic clean** — no residual (verified the real `tokens used\n<N>` + `: N` forms
  still parse, no backtracking, no off-by-one).
- **UI (review-only).** `SessionRail` Tokens block drops the `phase 2` placeholder; new `useRunUsage` hook sums the
  newest run's per-task `token-usage.json` on the client (404-tolerant — a task with no usage file is skipped, never
  fails the summary). `formatTokens` (`52.4k`/`2.1M`) + `formatCost` helpers. `TokenUsageDoc` mirror in `api.ts`.
- **Verification.** 654 tests (+19: 13 usage, 2 claude, 3 codex, 3 conductor incl. best-effort-throw), typecheck+build
  green (root+ui), CI green 4/4. **Browser-smoke** on a seeded serve (scratchpad project, port 7822): rail rendered
  `this run 52.4k · cost $0.0473` (client aggregate over one task-with-usage + one 404 task tolerated); screenshot sent
  to operator; seeded project + daemon torn down. Self-merged (machine bar: codex-clean + green CI).
- **Batch-merge note (git mechanics).** The s21 docs commit `66e04c7` was committed locally on main but never pushed
  (direct push to main is classifier-gated → docs ride with the next PR per AGENTS.md). GitHub's squash of PR #41 folded
  BOTH the s21 docs AND the s22 module into `675baf0`; `git diff 66e04c7 HEAD -- docs/` = only the new spec file, so all
  s21 content is preserved in main (the commit OBJECT isn't in linear history, but its content is — exactly how
  batch-merges are meant to work). Reset local main to `origin/main` to drop a spurious pull-merge commit.
- No new gotchas (the `parseCodexTokens` lesson is a code-review catch, not a repeated-mistake gotcha; count stays 33).

## s21 — 2026-07-04 — woodev deps-provisioning ops-proof LANDED → P3 loop proven end-to-end (COMMIT `912ef64`)

Operator on `/remote-control` chose the operator-gated ops-proof (Task 9 of the deps-provisioning plan) and observed —
the last open P3 item. The deps-provisioning CODE shipped back in s15 (PR #29); s21 is the live proof on a real,
production-shaped project.
- **Setup.** Local `git clone` of `woodev_framework` → disposable `D:/Projects/woodev-harness-clone`, branch
  `autodev/s21-proof`. Untracked `.autodev` (PS-loop's) + `.serena` (MCP churn) via `.git/info/exclude` so runtime/MCP
  writes can't dirty the merge tree. Copied gitignored `vendor` (76M) + `plugins-reference` (17M) from the original.
  Bumped the clone's phpstan `--memory-limit` 2G→4G (base phpstan crashed a parallel worker at 2G — env, not code:
  `[OK] No errors` at 4G; full `composer check` green on the main tree at 98s). `.autodev/config.yaml`:
  `worktree.provision: [vendor, plugins-reference]`, worker claude/sonnet, critic codex/gpt-5.5/high. Task = a
  class-level PHPDoc on `woodev/box-packer/abstract-class-packer.php` (docs, non-contract-zone — mirrors aurora's proven
  docs task).
- **Green COMMIT.** `run --once` (detached Start-Process, cwd=clone) → worktree created with `vendor` +
  `plugins-reference` as NTFS junctions (verified) → worker (sonnet) wrote the docblock → critic (codex/gpt-5.5) `clean`
  0.88 → gate `composer check:static` (phpcs+phpstan) **GREEN in the worktree on the provisioned deps** →
  `gate-verdict.json` `composer_green:true decision:COMMIT` → **COMMIT `912ef64`** → link-only deprovision → safe
  teardown. Main `vendor` intact (5168), original `woodev_framework` untouched, tree clean.
- **KEY FINDING → new gotcha `[worktree/vendor-junction-autoload-basedir]`.** First attempt used the full `composer
  check` (incl. **phpunit**) and RETRY'd on exit 255. Root cause (reproduced standalone): phpunit EXECUTES the framework
  (loads a real plugin fixture through the resolver); `vendor` is a junction, so PHP resolves `__DIR__` inside Composer's
  autoloader to the junction's REAL target → `$baseDir` = the MAIN clone → project classes autoload from the main clone
  while worktree-relative `require_once` loads the worktree copy → `Cannot redeclare class Woodev_Packer`. Read-by-path
  tools (`php -l`/phpcs/phpstan) are unaffected — hence the static gate for the green run. A runtime phpunit gate needs
  per-worktree `vendor` materialization (backlog).
- **`[worktree/win-junction-follow]` re-confirmed live, the hard way.** A NON-link-safe manual repro cleanup (bash
  `rmdir` on a live junction — which fails silently and leaves it — then `git worktree remove --force`) followed the
  junction and wiped the disposable clone's real `vendor/` (original untouched; recopied). The harness's OWN teardown
  was safe every time (link-only deprovision logged before recursive removal). Lesson: never bash-`rmdir` a live
  junction; use PowerShell `(Get-Item link).Delete()` / the harness `removeLinkOnly`.
- Docs: CURRENT-STATE (P3 CLOSED), 1 new gotcha (32→33). No harness source changed (ops-proof only). main tip advances
  with this docs commit.

## s20 — 2026-07-04 — Project Settings edit mode extended to every role field (PR #40); token/usage instrumentation scoped for s21

Operator went to sleep at session start with full autonomy granted ("работай автономно... мержи, пушь"). Woodev
ops-proof stayed gated, untouched. Picked the lowest-risk, best-scoped remaining backlog item by judgement rather
than starting the two larger/design-uncertain ones unsupervised.
- **PR #40 — Project Settings: `roles.orchestrator`/`roles.worker.adapter`/`roles.critic` now editable.** Closes the
  s19 note ("roles.* scoped out of the first cut"). Pure UI — backend (`PATCH /projects/:id/config` +
  `ScaffoldFormSchema`) already accepted these fields since PR #37. 7 new `TextFieldRow`s; `buildDiff`/`addIfChanged`
  send only per-role sub-fields that actually changed, mirroring the established `checkCommand` convention.
  Review-only (no conductor touch). **Browser-live-proven on the REAL aurora sandbox**: edited
  `roles.orchestrator.model`, confirmed the live config projection updated immediately (hub-evict from s19 still
  holding), reverted via a second UI edit. codex GPT-5.5 review: no blockers. CI green 4/4, self-merged.
- **Scoped, deliberately NOT built: token/usage instrumentation for the Tokens rail.** Sizing call: touches
  worker/critic adapters + the conductor (persist per-task/run usage) — needs the full TDD→gate discipline, not a
  quick polish item. Findings for s21: Claude worker already runs `--output-format stream-json` and already
  captures stdout (`WatchedRunResult.stdout`) — the final `result` event has a ready-made `usage` object, no new
  adapter flag needed. Codex critic's plain-text stdout ends with a `tokens used\n<N>` line (confirmed live in this
  session's own codex-review call) — parseable, or switch to `--json` for a structured event. Full findings in
  `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` NEXT ACTIONS #2.
- Also flagged `run rename/archive/fork` as NOT actually scoped (no `name` field on the run manifest today, no
  defined archive/fork semantics) — needs a short design pass before implementation, unlike the s19 project-rename
  precedent it superficially resembles.
- No new gotchas this session.
- main tip = `565bab2`. Working tree clean at session end.

## s19 — 2026-07-04 — 3 P3 backlog items shipped & merged (PR #36, #37, #38) — registry rename, config-write, switcher menu

Operator away for most of the session (auto-mode); the woodev ops-proof stayed gated (untouched). Picked backlog items by
judgement, full worker→spec-check→codex-gate→re-critic→self-merge discipline throughout.
- **PR #36 — `PATCH /projects/:id` rename** (registry `name` only; `id`/`path` immutable). codex clean; 2 minor
  test-coverage gaps closed with regression tests. 612 tests. Browser-live E2E (API all paths + UI inline rename,
  sidebar re-fetch).
- **PR #37 — `PATCH /projects/:id/config`** (project settings editable in UI). `mergeConfigYaml` preserves hand-set
  fields the form doesn't cover; `hub.evict(id)` on write success (else the live daemon keeps the stale gate/role
  config — real bug caught by design review, not codex). codex found 2 blockers: (1) `config.yaml` itself unguarded
  against symlinks (only `.autodev` dir was) — fixed + regression test; (2) claimed `hub.evict` in-flight-build race —
  investigated against the full `get()` control flow, NOT reproducible, codex confirmed on re-review. Re-critic clean.
  633 tests. **Browser-live-proven on the REAL aurora sandbox** (not a fixture): edited `roles.worker.ladder`, confirmed
  hand-set `roles.critic.*`/`gate.checkCommand` survived, reverted.
- **PR #38 — composer project-switcher** — real dropdown menu replacing the static chip. Pure frontend, review-only.
- Ran the daemon live for the operator mid-session (aurora + throwaway registry) — operator independently registered a
  REAL project (`woodev-shipping-plugin-test`) via the New Project flow while watching; left it untouched.
- 3 new gotchas: `[hub/evict-on-config-write]`, `[scaffold/config-file-symlink]`, `[config/yaml-merge-drops-comments]`.
- main tip = `a65cd60`. Working tree clean at session end.

## s18 — 2026-07-04 — P3 product shell CLOSED: M4-7 settings screens + M5 light theme — merged (PR #34)

**M4-7 settings + M5 light theme (PR #34 `75f9675`, review-only static UI).** Built directly by the main session (cohesive
UI against the already-loaded design system), then an independent code-review pass — no codex gate (static presentation UI:
"review, don't gate").
- **Global `/settings`** (`GlobalSettingsView`): Appearance (theme control), Projects registry (list + two-step click→confirm
  unregister via `useDeleteProject`, live list invalidation), Daemon info (conn from the WS store / `location.host` / count).
- **Project `/p/:id/settings`** (`ProjectSettingsView`): read-first projection over `GET /projects/:id/config`
  (repo / gate / branch pattern / provision / roles) + note that editing stays file-based (config-WRITE endpoint = next add).
- **`SettingsLayout` kit** (page/section/row) shared by both; router replaces the two "coming in M4-7" placeholders;
  AppShell excludes `/settings` from the session-rail predicate.
- **M5:** `[data-theme="light"]` override block in `styles.css` remaps the chrome (ink/panel/surface/line/text), status +
  verdict hues stay shared. Completes the `System·Dark·Light` switcher that was already wired in `lib/theme.ts`.
- **Browser-live-proven** (Playwright, seeded registry = aurora real config + a defaults project): both screens dark + light,
  theme persists across nav, and a **real end-to-end unregister** (registry file on disk + sidebar + count all updated live).
  typecheck clean, CI green 4/4. Review: ship-ready; 2 sub-threshold polish notes applied (stale `theme.ts` comment;
  `del.reset()` on cancel to drop a stale delete-error).

**Merge-permission friction fixed at the root.** The auto-mode classifier repeatedly denied `gh pr merge`
("[Merge Without Review]") because no `permissions.allow` rule existed — and the agent surfaced it to the operator as a
question, which he was (rightly) fed up with. Root cause: docs say "self-merge" but the classifier is a separate gate. Fix =
`.claude/settings.json` with `Bash(gh pr merge:*)` (+ create/checks/view). The agent **cannot self-write** it (writing your
own auto-execute permission is itself classifier-blocked as "[Self-Modification]") — so the operator created it. Memory
sharpened: a classifier merge-deny is a mechanical blocker to RETRY, never a fork to route to the operator.

**Gotchas:** `[registry/json-win-backslash]` (hand-written Windows `\` paths → invalid JSON → silent empty registry; use
`/`), `[ui/light-theme-tokens]` (the `[data-theme]` re-cascade depends on plain `@theme` not `@theme inline`; shared status
hues are fine as dots but marginal as text on light).

---

## s17 — 2026-07-03/04 — P3: M3 (New Project backend) + M4 (product shell UI) — both codex/CI-clean, both merged (PR #31, #32)

**M3 — New Project flow backend (PR #31 `7c80a90`, codex-gated).** `GET /fs/dirs` server-side folder browser (dirs-only,
git/registered badges, symlinks annotated with resolved target, `invalid_path`→400-never-500), `POST /projects` (register +
optional `.autodev/` scaffold), `DELETE /projects/:id` (registry-only, before root-resolve so a broken-config project is still
deletable, closes its watcher). Scaffold: config.yaml validated through the real strict schema BEFORE any write, blackboard
skeleton + GOAL/INVARIANTS stubs (`wx`, never clobber), idempotent `.git/info/exclude`, config last. `isPathRegistered`
extracted + reused; register/unregister behind a promise-chain mutex. Codex R1 **broken** (4) → HIGH symlink-escape fixed →
re-critic **uncertain** (narrower symlinked-child residual) → fixed → **clean**. Windows CI caught an 8.3-short-path realpath
divergence (green locally) → fixed. 592→596 tests, CI green 4/4.

**Autonomy rule sharpened.** Operator: "мержи сам, не жди меня; дёргать ТОЛЬКО на развилках где 100% нужно моё участие."
Codified in `AGENTS.md` (agent owns ALL git+GH incl. merges; gate on machine bar + green CI, then self-merge) + memory.

**M4 — product shell UI (PR #32 `c121a05`, review-only + one gated backend add).** projectId moved into the router path
(`/p/:id/…`), query-keys/api/ws gained the projectId dimension, `ProjectGate` shim deleted; M3 api hooks; **gated** read-only
`GET /projects/:id/config` (curated config for the shell); multi-project sidebar (last-5 runs + verdict seals, settings
popover, theme control); composer-first Home + top bar; session-inspector rail (Now/Queue/Session/Roles/Tokens-placeholder);
New Project screen (folder browser + register form). **M4-7 settings screens deferred** (honest placeholder routes).
**Browser-live-proven end-to-end** (Playwright): shell renders aurora's real config; New Project flow driven fully from the
browser — folder browser → select fresh git repo → register → `.autodev/` scaffolded on disk + git-exclude + registry entry →
redirect → immediately drivable. Subagent-driven (sonnet+opus by complexity); config endpoint codex **clean**; CI green 4/4.
New gotchas: `[ci/win-83-realpath]`, `[scaffold/symlink-escape]`.

## s16 — 2026-07-03 — P3 slice 2: UI/UX design gate + multi-project daemon M1–M2 — codex-gated clean, merged (PR #30)

**Design gate (the operator's reserved topic, resolved WITH him):** operator brought 11 reference screenshots
(Codex/Claude desktop → `screenshots/`, git-ignored) + his wishlist (New Project, projects+sessions sidebar, settings
popover, stats rail). Three forks decided: **full multi-project daemon** (not single-active rebind), **browser now /
desktop wrap later** (loopback HTTP/WS makes the wrap additive), **server-side folder browser**. Visual mockup built in
our design tokens → `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-s16-shell-mockup.html`; kanban stays a secondary lens. Spec
(`2026-07-03-p3-multiproject-shell-design.md`, modules M1–M5) approved on trust; M1–M2 plan written and executed.

**Built (M1–M2):** identity-only registry `~/.autodev/projects.json` (project truth stays in `.autodev/config.yaml`);
`buildProjectRoot` extracted from `index.ts` into `src/composition/root.ts`; **ProjectHub** (lazy per-project roots,
error isolation, path-aware caches); API re-rooted under `/projects/:id/...` (old top-level routes removed, `GET
/projects`, per-project orchestrate single-flight, per-project watchers, WS events carry `projectId`); `serve` is
daemon-global with the UI bundle resolved install-relative (**closes `[ui/serve-uidir-reporoot]`**); interim UI shim
auto-selects the first project. CLI verbs stay cwd-bound.

**Gate:** codex GPT-5.5 R1 `broken` 0.87 — 7 findings, incl. three genuine classes: shared in-flight promise rejection
escaping the hub's cached branch (500 instead of 503); id-keyed caches surviving a registry re-bind (orchestrating the
WRONG repo); the "mechanical" extraction making the orchestrator eager (broke `run` for orchestrator-less configs).
All fixed w/ regression tests → R2 `broken` 0.82 (2 residual: stale-watcher broadcast, path-less `lastError`) → fixed →
**R3 `clean`**. 537 tests (was 512), typecheck clean, CI green 4/4, squash-merged → `main` `6337215` (PR #30).
Subagent-driven: 5 sonnet + 2 opus workers, 3 codex rounds. New gotchas: `[ts/shared-promise-reject]`,
`[refactor/extraction-eagerness]`, `[multiproject/id-keyed-caches]`.

**Next:** M3 (fs-browser + register + scaffold), M4 (shell UI per mockup), M5 (themes); ops live-proof of
deps-provisioning on a woodev clone still deferred (operator-observed). Roles confirmed: Fable 5 = brain, Sonnet 5 /
Opus 4.8 = workers by complexity, codex GPT-5.5 = critic.

---

## s15 — 2026-07-03 — P3 slice 1: deps-provisioning (real test gate in worktrees) — codex-gated clean, merged (PR #29)

**Context:** P2 done. Design-gated P3 with the operator (reference-first: reconned AO + OD Electron shells). Operator
scoped the first slice to **"real-use gaps"** — close what blocks the harness taking REAL tasks off the PS-loop — and
chose the target: a **clone of `woodev_framework`** (most relevant, safe). Recon of the live woodev (read-only) found:
real gate = `composer check` (phpcs+phpstan+phpunit, no DB); **`plugins-reference/` is gitignored but load-bearing**;
no `.autodev/config.yaml` (PS config is hardcoded in `_common.ps1`). Spec + 9-task TDD plan written & approved.

**Built (Finding #1): `worktree.provision`** — links gitignored dep dirs (`vendor`, `plugins-reference`) into each
per-task worktree (junction/Windows, dir-symlink/POSIX) so the gate graduates `php -l` → `composer check`. Empty = off
(backward compat). Config block (`.strict()`, top-level segments) + link/unlink in the worktree manager + composition-root wiring.

**The hard part — a real, reproduced data-loss class caught by the gate.** sonnet-5 TDD → **4 rounds of independent
codex GPT-5.5 gate**, each closing a genuine reproduced defect: (R1) `removeLinkOnly` swallowed failures / deleted
non-links / host-only absolute check + 4 more; (R2) cleanup used only the current config → stale links survived a
config change; (R3) a best-effort manifest is not authoritative (write-fail/corruption); (R3b) recursive strip removed
tracked source symlinks. **Key discovery (verified 6/6):** on Windows `git worktree remove --force` **FOLLOWS an NTFS
junction and recursively deletes its real target**. Final design: **link-only-remove EVERY top-level reparse point
BEFORE any recursive removal; refuse to recurse otherwise; restrict provision entries to a single top-level segment**
so the non-recursive scan is complete. R4 verdict: **`clean` (0.88)**; only residual = nested FOREIGN junctions
(pre-existing git-on-Windows behavior, not introduced here) → documented. Gotcha `[worktree/win-junction-follow]`.

**Result:** 502 tests, typecheck clean, **CI green 4/4**, squash-merged → `main` `dc8b6cd` (PR #29). Subagent-driven
throughout (1 implementer + spec-review subagent + 4 codex fix/re-critic rounds). **Not yet done: the ops live-proof
on a woodev clone** (deferred — heavy live run) and the **project picker / UI-UX** (operator wants to design it next).

**Process note (operator feedback, s15):** stop pinging on decidable gate-fix questions — decide & proceed; reserve
decisions for UI/UX + real merges/live-proofs. Saved as `feedback-decide-dont-ask`. Communicate RESULTS, not activity.

## s14 — 2026-07-02 — P2 Module 5 (dashboard UI) shipped + LIVE-PROVEN on aurora through the browser

**Context:** s13 shipped the P2 backend; the ONE thing left was Module 5 — the React/Vite UI itself. Operator
chose to **discuss layout FIRST**. Read all anchors; reconned the in-project donor frontends (AO + OD) BEFORE
designing (reference-first). **open-warehouse dropped as a reference** — operator: refs live only in `references/`
(the design spec + s13 promt wrongly cited it). Saved a feedback memory.

**Layout, signed off:** operator steered to an **agent-desktop IA** (Claude Code / Codex / Devin desktop) — not a
kanban-hero: sidebar runs-list + transcript-forward main + inspector rail, **critic verdict FIRST-CLASS** as a
"verdict seal" (the thesis, made visible). Task detail = its own 2-pane route. Design direction (frontend-design
skill): control-room dark ink, verdict tones the only saturated color, mono-forward type (Plex Mono/Sans + Space Grotesk).

**One gated backend add — `GET /escalations/:id`** (the A/B card needs the escalation body; escalation id == task id,
so no list endpoint). sonnet TDD (`parseEscalation` inverts `buildBody`; TOCTOU-hardened bounded read) → my spec-check
→ **codex GPT-5.5 gate `broken`, 4 findings** → 3 fixed w/ regression tests (evidence containing a ``` fence
round-trips via backward close-scan; field lookup restricted to pre-evidence; `parsed.id === :id`), **1 declined w/
rationale** (final-component no-follow is consistent with sibling endpoints) → **re-critic `clean`**. 480 tests.

**UI (reviewed, not gated):** own `ui/` workspace (heavy toolchain out of the daemon build), Vite → `dist/ui`;
hand-rolled shadcn-idiom primitives (no headless dep → reliable build); `@fontsource` (offline). Screens: Home
(hero + composer), Board (5 queues by attention tone, done collapsed), Run transcript, Task detail (2-pane:
escalation A/B + spec + lifecycle | inspector Verdict/Diff/Report/Files). Live via existing WS → React-Query invalidate.

**Verified for real (Playwright — Claude-in-Chrome was offline):** (1) demo — real api-server over a seeded stateDir:
board/detail render, escalation A/B reply writes the file, diff colors, BROKEN seal, `POST /orchestrate` → 202 → WS →
new run appears live. (2) **LIVE on aurora via `serve` (detached — sidesteps `[orchestrator/bg-spawn-killed]`),
driven from the browser composer:** opus decompose (~20s) → claude worker → `php -l` gate → **codex critic `uncertain`
→ escalated** → new endpoint → A/B card + UNCERTAIN seal (real critic notes: "unverified contract statement… no test")
→ **reply B written to the live daemon**. The gate refused an unverified docblock contract claim — the thesis, live.

**Git:** branch `autodev/s14-dashboard-ui` (3 code commits + folds the s13-session-save docs). PR pending (supersedes #27).
**Gotchas:** `[ui/serve-uidir-reporoot]`, `[ui/verdict-not-persisted]`. Aurora reset to master, temp branch deleted.

## s13 — 2026-07-02 — P2 dashboard BACKEND shipped (design-gate → 4 gated modules → PR #26 merged)

**Context:** s12 closed the orchestrate live-proof; s13 priority = P2 localhost dashboard. Ran a **design
gate FIRST** (s11 pattern): Plan subagent authored `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-p2-dashboard-design.md`;
🔴 forks surfaced to the operator. Operator steered two ways that reshaped the spec: (1) frontend on the
**same stack as open-warehouse** (React 19 + Vite + TanStack + shadcn/Tailwind + zustand — shadcn/Tailwind
is the point, NOT open-warehouse's axios→Laravel coupling); (2) pick transport + run-model **from our donor
references, not invent** → dispatched parallel Explore agents over **AO** and **OD**. Findings: both donors
use HTTP `/api` + React-Query + **SSE**; OD has a per-run `runs/<id>/events.jsonl`; **AO has no transcript
UI** (confirms `[ao/ui]`). Resolved forks: keep our WS (not SSE — already gated), OD-style per-run **manifest**,
read + escalation + **launch orchestrate** in scope, bind 127.0.0.1. New feedback memory: **check donor refs
first on any architectural fork.**

**Four backend modules — each sonnet TDD → controller spec-check → codex GPT-5.5 gate → re-critic (never
self-certified):**
1. **run manifest** (`recordRun` capability) — `<stateDir>/runs/<run-id>.json` after enqueue; best-effort,
   R1-safe (report family). codex: 1 High + 2 residuals, all `[ts/fail-closed]` (throwing logger / message
   getter / non-string toString) → fixed + regression tests → APPROVE.
2. **read endpoints** — `GET /runs`, `/runs/:id`, `/tasks/:id/runtime[/:name]`. codex: 1 High (symlink
   follow) + 4 Med → symlink+size **TOCTOU-hardened** (no-follow fd + fstat), best-effort never-500, bounded
   reads → APPROVE.
3. **serve verb + static** — `serve [--port N]` binds 127.0.0.1, serves `dist/ui` as LAST fallback. codex:
   1 High (**intermediate symlink-dir escape** — lstat+O_NOFOLLOW only guard the FINAL component) → **realpath
   containment**; SPA fallback via cross-platform lexical check (errno differs by OS). 1 TOCTOU residual
   documented + codex-accepted (needs openat2, unavailable in Node; matches serve-static). → APPROVE.
4. **POST /orchestrate** — 202-async + single-flight (409), R1 preserved (api gets only a thin `onOrchestrate`
   callback; `buildOrchestrator` shared with the CLI verb). codex: 1 Med + 1 Low (`[ts/fail-closed]` again +
   log-forging) → fail-closed background chain + `flattenForLog` → APPROVE.

**Result:** 447 tests / 2 skip, typecheck clean, **CI green 4/4**, PR **#26 squash-merged → `main` `5a7963a`**.
R1 trip-wire green; no new `BlackboardRepository` method; `src/api/**` imports nothing from gate/worker/
critic/worktree/orchestrator. **Module 5 (the React/Vite UI itself) is NEXT** — paused for operator layout/UX
input. Editing note: literal control-byte regex literals are unmaintainable via the Edit tool — write control
classes via char-code checks (`codePointAt`) or `\r\n`-style escapes, never literal bytes.

## s12 — 2026-07-02 — `orchestrate` LIVE-PROVEN end-to-end on aurora (green COMMIT)

**Context:** s11 built the whole adr/003 layer; the ONE thing left was a live end-to-end proof of the
`orchestrate` path (the orchestrator's equivalent of the s09 P1 live proof). Read all anchors. Ran the
real thing on the disposable `aurora` sandbox (branch `autodev/s12-orch-proof` off `autodev/live-proof`;
`.autodev/` git-excluded; dependency-free gate `php -l …/LlmServiceFactory.php`; orchestrator role
defaults to `claude/opus`). Took **3 live runs** (the promt predicted decompose-prompt iteration).

**Run 1 — `supports()` intent → ESCALATE `dirty-file`.** opus decompose emitted a self-contradictory
spec: `forbidden_paths: ["…/Llm/*", "!…/LlmServiceFactory.php"]` — gitignore-style `!` negation the
harness glob matcher (`*`/`?`/`**` only) does NOT support. The `*` glob matched the very file `file_set`
required, so the dirty-file fence flagged the legit edit as forbidden → escalate before gate. `validateTaskSpec`
had ACCEPTED the impossible spec. **Enforcement worked; the decompose output was bad.**

**The fix (branch `autodev/s12-orch-liveproof`, commit `e7dbb46`):** sonnet subagent (TDD, no commit) →
my spec-check (parity vs fence's `forbiddenTouches`) → **codex GPT-5.5 gate: APPROVE, no findings**.
(1) `task-spec.ts` superRefine rejects any spec where a `forbidden_paths` glob matches a `file_set` entry,
reusing the fence's EXACT normalize-then-`globMatch` semantics (validator never diverges from enforcement);
(2) `decompose-prompt.ts` documents `forbidden_paths` semantics to the LLM (no `!`/gitignore, never overlap
`file_set`, leave empty for "touch only these files"). `normalizePath` moved to `util/glob.ts` (exported,
reused). +6 tests, typecheck clean, full suite 384 pass / 2 skip.

**Run 2 — `supports()` (rebuilt) → ESCALATE `uncertain`.** Clean pipeline this time (decompose→validate→
worker DONE→fence clean→gate), but the **codex critic correctly returned `uncertain` (0.86 conf)**: a new
public contract with no test, and aurora's dependency-free gate can't run phpunit to prove parity with
`make()`. The gate did its job — "never merge bullshit."

**Run 3 — class-docblock intent → GREEN COMMIT.** Self-evident, no new contract. Full live path:
opus decompose → clean spec → validate → enqueue → trigger → claude worker → gate `php -l` → **codex
critic `clean`** → **COMMIT `2c77106`** → merge to branch → worktree torn down. Task in `done/`, tree clean.
**R1 held**: orchestrator only authored the task file; all enforcement ran in the deterministic conductor.

**Operational gotcha:** background `orchestrate` runs get KILLED during the nested `claude` (opus) decompose
spawn in this Claude Code environment — **foreground runs succeed reliably**. Two gotchas filed.

---

## s11 — 2026-07-02 — R3 role registry SHIPPED (PR #21) + orchestrator design started

**Context:** First build session of the post-P1 architecture. Read all anchors (VISION, AGENTS, CURRENT-STATE,
GOTCHAS, adr/003, parity-spec §2/§5/§6/§7). Operator flagged that AGENTS.md was missing from the session-start
protocol → added it. Operator authorized **overnight autonomous mode** (subagent-driven + codex critic; merge
after codex-gate + green CI, pre-authorized).

**R3 — role registry + per-adapter config (adr/003 R3) — SHIPPED & MERGED (PR #21, `d07e72c`):**
- Two skeleton-adjacent forks surfaced to operator before coding: (Q1) where vendor knobs live → **role-shaped
  entries** (knobs inside each role, operator deferred to my judgment); (Q2) migration → **hard-cut to `roles:`**.
- sonnet-5 implementer (TDD, no commit) → my spec-check vs parity §7 → **codex GPT-5.5 gate**. Flat `worker:`/
  `critic:` → `roles: {orchestrator, worker, critic, planner}` + `policy.heterogeneity`. Worker keeps `ladder`
  (parity §7 intact). New `src/config/roles.ts` (adapter family/exe resolution, `assertKnownAdapters` fail-loud,
  heterogeneity policy). All 6 consumers migrated.
- **codex findings:** (1 High) legacy flat configs silently stripped → fixed with root `.strict()` (fail loud) +
  regression test; (2 Med) empty `ladder` passes schema then throws at runtime → fixed with `.min(1)` (NOT min(2):
  single-element ladder is valid per §7); (3 Med) heterogeneity-warn unreachable → **declined** (assert-before-warn
  is intentional; warning is forward-looking). **Re-critic clean.** typecheck clean, 287 tests, CI green 4/4.
- aurora `.autodev/config.yaml` migrated to `roles:` (else `.strict()` would reject it).

**R1/R2 orchestrator layer — FULLY BUILT (overnight, subagent-driven + codex critic):** operator authorized
overnight autonomy + pre-authorized merges (gate+green-CI). Plan subagent produced the design spec
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-orchestrator-layer-design.md`), 5 skeleton-shaping forks surfaced 🔴, operator
approved "да по всем" (A1 staged pipeline · B1 CLI verb · C1 decompose-only claude/opus adapter · D digest+stdout
report · E strict validateTaskSpec).
- **Substrate (PR #22):** `TaskSpec`/`validateTaskSpec` (sole trust boundary for LLM-authored tasks), `serializeTask`
  (proven inverse of `parseTask`), standalone `writeTaskToPending` (frozen-seam-safe), read/report caps, and a
  mechanical R1 import trip-wire. codex: 6 findings fixed + re-critic clean.
- **Logic (wave 1):** decompose-only `ClaudeOrchestratorAdapter` (one-shot `claude -p`, `cwd:repoRoot`, tolerant
  balanced-bracket JSON parse) + staged `createOrchestrator().handleIntent` (snapshot→decompose→validate-all-or-
  nothing→transactional-enqueue-with-rollback→bounded-trigger(skip-on-empty)→report). codex: 4 findings + a
  re-critic consistency fix (empty array = valid no-op).
- **Wiring (wave 2):** `index.ts` composition root builds exactly the 4 caps; `trigger` = bounded `conductor.run`
  closure (no gate/worker/commit handle reaches the orchestrator — R1 mechanically held). New `orchestrate
  "<intent>"` CLI verb. codex: 1 finding (argless trigger unbounded) fixed. Build + CLI smoke-tested.
- Result: `node dist/index.js orchestrate "<intent>"` decomposes intent → task files → triggers the un-bypassable
  gate. 378 tests, typecheck clean. **NOT yet live-proven end-to-end on a real repo** (s12).

---

## s10 — 2026-07-02 — `adr/003` design gate → **accepted** (role matrix + LLM orchestrator)

**Context:** Continued from s09 (P1 DONE, 272 tests, all merged, no tail). s10 was a **design gate, not a
build sprint** — the next-session prompt forbade starting orchestrator code until `adr/003`'s open questions
were resolved with the operator. Read the anchors + `adr/003` fully, then ran the design conversation.

**Resolved all 4 open questions with the operator (all recommended options chosen):**
- **R1 boundary — orchestrator STRICTLY ABOVE the pure-code conductor.** The LLM gets exactly 4 capabilities:
  enqueue a `queue/pending/*.md` task file, trigger the loop, read blackboard state, report + drive kanban.
  Every enforcement step (`claim→worktree→worker→harvest→fence→critic→gate→commit`) stays in the deterministic
  conductor; **no** `run_worker`/`run_critic`/`run_gate`/`commit` tool. The LLM's only enforcement-path write is
  a task file the scheduler independently validates → preserves the PS-oracle "can't talk past the gate" 1:1.
- **R2 planner — folded into the orchestrator for MVP**, reserved as a registry role id; output = `queue/pending/*.md`.
- **R3 config — unified `roles:` registry** (`{adapter,model,effort?,exe?}` per role) + global defaults + sparse
  per-project override + `policy.heterogeneity: warn`. Flat `worker`/`critic` blocks migrate in — the axis-2/6
  generalization the frozen skeleton anticipated, not a break.
- **R4 orchestrator window/session model — deferred to P2** (window-shaped, over the read-only `api` seam).

**Deliverable:** `adr/003` proposed → **accepted** (Resolution R1–R4 + rewritten Consequences); `VISION.md` banner
+ `CURRENT-STATE.md` (open question resolved, NEXT ACTIONS re-pointed to s11) updated. **No source changed** — by
design. Docs-only → **PR #18 merged to `main` (`6b7ab2b`)** (operator-approved the gated squash-merge; the
self-approval classifier correctly blocked the agent's own auto-merge). No codex gate (pure docs, per restraint rule).

**Next (s11), now buildable:** (1) role registry + per-adapter config (R3, config/adapter change, full discipline
+ codex gate), then (2) the additive orchestrator layer (R1/R2) on the existing scheduler + run entrypoint + `api` seam.

## s09 — 2026-07-02 — live build-step-9 on a real repo → **P1 real-world DoD reached** (green COMMIT)

**Context:** Continued from s08 (265 tests, PR #13 merged). Step 0 tails: wrote the `[node/stdin-epipe]`
gotcha (count 11→12), saved 2 cross-project TS/Node learnings to Supermemory — docs branch → **PR #15 merged**.

**Build-step-9 — the last P1 gate — done.** Ran the harness end-to-end on a REAL woodev-class repo with a
live `claude` worker + live `codex` critic and reached a **green COMMIT** matching the PS oracle.
- **Target:** operator dropped `open-warehouse` (dirty tree) → picked `aurora` (disposable Laravel sandbox
  in `d:/projects/`). Dependency-free gate `php -l server/app/Services/Llm/LlmServiceFactory.php`; task `live01`
  (name supported providers in the unsupported-provider error). Runs on `autodev/live-proof`, `.autodev/` git-excluded.
- **First run → ESCALATE (dirty-file):** the worker wrote `worker-report.md` into the worktree root → fence
  flagged it stray → no task can COMMIT. **Finding #4 (blocking).**
- **Fix #4 (`ded192e`)** — `src/worker/report.ts` `harvestWorkerReport` relocates the report worktree→runtimeDir
  before status-read+fence (parity §6). codex gate returned **broken** (stale carry-over on retry/re-claim;
  non-atomic EXDEV; test covered only the status-read half) → fixed → **re-critic clean**.
- **Second run → `spawn codex ENOENT`:** fence PASSED (fix #4 proven live), reached the critic; node can't
  spawn the Windows `codex.cmd` shim. **Finding #5.** **Fix #5 (`76e0ab3`)** — `runNative` via `cross-spawn`;
  win32-gated regression test; codex-gated (only flagged risk = the added dep, satisfied).
- **Third run → GREEN COMMIT:** CLAIM → worktree → claude(sonnet) → harvest → fence(pass) → **codex `clean`
  (conf 0.76)** → gate `php -l` green → **COMMIT `3ffe028`** → task `done` + digest line. Oracle-equivalent.

**Merged:** both fixes → **PR #16 merged to `main` (`d137f2b`)**, all 4 CI cells green. 272 tests + 2 skipped.
**Findings captured:** #4/#5 (fixed) + 3 operational (worktree lacks deps; dirty tree breaks merge; `.autodev/`
must be git-excluded) → gotchas (count 12→15). **Discipline:** 3 codex gates + 2 re-critics (both caught
incomplete fixes) — never self-certified.

## s08 — 2026-07-01 — thin api + parity harness + cross-platform CI (P1 DoD, fixture side; steps 8–9 done)

**Context:** Continued from s07 (233 tests). s07 PR `feat/conductor-p1` already merged to `main` (#12) —
step 0 was a no-op. Branched `feat/p1-dod-api-parity-ci` off `main`. Same discipline: sonnet-5 implementers
(TDD, no commit) → controller spec-check vs the PS oracle/parity spec → whole-module codex GPT-5.5 gate →
adjudicate → fix + regression test → **re-critic every fix**.

**Built (sequential, one commit per task):**
- **Task 27 `src/api/server.ts`** (`77c3b36`) — thin `http`+`ws` over `BlackboardRepository` (P2 seam,
  read-only+reply-only). `GET /state` (5 queues + bounded digest tail), WS change-stream (injectable chokidar),
  `POST /escalations/:id/reply` = STRUCTURED A/B only (`note` free text is context, never a worker instruction —
  §8 injection surface). Frozen repo seam untouched; clean http+ws+watcher teardown. +13 tests.
- **Task 28 `test/parity/parity.test.ts`** (`3b17512`) — the **P1 DoD parity harness**: drives the REAL
  conductor + real FileBlackboardRepository + real scheduler + real escalate over a temp `.autodev` tree, fake
  worker/critic/worktree/git + scripted gate, asserting the same COMMIT/ESCALATE/RETRY + queue/escalation
  end-state as the PS oracle (§2). 18 scenarios: 5 core + divergences #1/#4/#8/#9/#10 + dirty-fence (stray +
  forbidden, each arm isolated) + critic-retry + NEEDS_GUARD/BLOCKED + merge-conflict + run() backoff.
- **Task 29 CI + schema fix** (`38adf44`) — GH Actions matrix win+linux × node 20/22 (`npm ci`→typecheck→test
  →build→assert schema in dist). Fixed deferred `[critic/codex]`: `scripts/copy-assets.mjs` (`postbuild`,
  cross-platform) copies `critic-verdict.schema.json` into `dist/critic/`. Also added `tsconfig.typecheck.json`
  (the parity harness surfaced that `tsconfig.json`'s `include:["src/**"]` made `npm run typecheck` vacuously
  green for `test/**`). **264 tests / 2 skipped, typecheck (src+test) clean.**

**Codex gates (3 module passes + 2 re-critics):**
- *api (Task 27):* 3 findings, all accepted (unbounded body → 1MB cap + 413 + socket teardown on finish; id
  guard → positive allowlist `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`; `/state` → bounded 64KB positioned digest tail). **Re-critic**
  caught an incomplete digest-tail fix (over-broad partial-line drop on an exact-boundary window) → over-read
  one byte + boundary regression test. My own first 413 fix was buggy (destroyed the socket before flushing →
  client reset) — fixed to teardown on response `finish`.
- *parity (Task 28):* 8 findings, all accepted — incl. one **"passes for the wrong reason"** (scenario 2 set
  BOTH contractRisk OR-arms). Hardened: split 2a/2b, gate/sleep call recorders, dirty-fence coverage,
  critic-retry, backoff, NEEDS_GUARD/BLOCKED, merge-conflict. **Re-critic** caught 2 vacuous assertions (the
  dirty-fence `stray:`/`forbidden:` labels are ALWAYS emitted → asserting the label passes regardless of
  content; forbidden test didn't isolate the forbidden arm) → assert actual paths + isolate the arm.

**Gotchas found:** `[ts/typecheck-scope]` (emit-scoped `tsconfig` `include:["src/**"]` silently skips `test/**`
in `tsc` → typecheck vacuously green there; separate `noEmit` typecheck config). `[api/413-teardown]`
(destroying an HTTP socket on oversized body before flushing the response = client reset, not 413; teardown on
response `finish`). `[test/vacuous-assert]` (parity-harness lesson: assert the value, not an always-present
label; isolate one OR-arm per test).

**CI flake found+fixed on the PR (`790ffc9`):** the first cross-platform run went red on ONE cell
(ubuntu/node20) — a real EPIPE race in `src/util/native.ts`: writing `child.stdin` with no `'error'`
listener, so a git child that closes its read end fast made `stdin.end()` throw an UNHANDLED EPIPE and crash
the run (the other 3 cells passed on timing). Fixed at the root (swallow the benign stdin write error;
stdout/stderr/exit are captured separately) + a deterministic regression test (exit-before-reading-1MB-stdin).
NOT "re-run until green" — that would hide the bug. Re-run → **all 4 cells green** (ubuntu+windows × node
20/22): the Windows lock is provably gone.

**Merged:** PR **#13** → `main` (`cde17a2`, merge commit, 5 commits incl. the EPIPE fix). Branch deleted, `main`
synced. **P1 fixture-side DoD = done.**

**Deferred tails (→ s09):** write the `[node/stdin-epipe]` gotcha file; save 1–2 cross-project TS/Node learnings
(`[ts/typecheck-scope]`, EPIPE) to Supermemory.

**Next:** build step 9's live woodev workload (operator picks target) = the P1 real-world DoD.

## s07 — 2026-07-01 — Conductor loop + scheduler + composition root (step 7 done; loop runs end-to-end)

**Context:** Continued from s06 (193 tests). Same discipline: sonnet-5 implementers (TDD, no commit) →
controller spec-check vs the PS oracle → whole-module codex GPT-5.5 gate → adjudicate → fix + regression
test → **re-critic the fixes**. Branch `feat/conductor-p1`.

**Built (SEQUENTIAL — the conductor is one tightly-coupled module):**
- **Task 23.5 `scheduler/scheduler.ts`** (plan-gap; the numbered tasks skipped it) — port of `scheduler.ps1`:
  deps-first then file_set disjointness vs active∪escalated locks, atomic claim with lost-race skip,
  `listClaimable` report; pure over `BlackboardRepository` (fake-repo testable). 9→10 tests.
- **Tasks 24–26 `conductor/conductor.ts`** — the whole parity §2 spine + outer loop, pure wiring/zero-LLM,
  full DI so all 8 self-tests run on fakes with zero subprocesses. Honors divergences #1 (worktree
  adaptation), #4 (RETRY→pending, not refunded), #8 (symmetric worker+critic 429 refund), #9
  (MaxSessionHours at top), #10 (commit-time branch re-check). 26→28 tests.
- **Step-7 close-out (parallel subagents):** `src/index.ts` production composition root (thin entry: flags →
  construct every real dep → `conductor.run`) + `src/util/log.ts`; and worktree `create()` made
  **re-queue-safe** (prune + remove --force + rm stale dir + branch -D before add) + taskId traversal guard.
  **233 tests / 2 skipped, typecheck clean** (was 193).

**Codex gates (two whole-module passes + two re-critics):**
- *Conductor+scheduler diff:* 5 findings → **2 rejected as faithful to the PS oracle** (activeSets computed
  once before the scan; `TrimStart('./')` is a char-set trim that strips `../` identically), **3 accepted**:
  scheduler imposes its own id order (don't rely on repo ordering), commit-time re-check must also require
  `cur === loopBranch`, teardown-in-finally must not reject a decided iteration. **Re-critic** refuted the
  teardown fix as incomplete (catch-block `log()` had no never-throws contract) → `safeLog` + throwing-logger
  test (the `[ts/fail-closed]` gotcha again).
- *Integration diff:* 6 findings → **2 deferred with docs** (`zonesTouchedInDiff` main-root invariants;
  `splitCommand` not quote-aware), **4 fixed**: guard-recipe matched by full row identity (per-value #2),
  `--max-iterations` validated as a positive int, taskId path-traversal guard, orphaned-dir rm. **Re-critic**
  caught the `--max-iterations` fix missing the no-value case → closed.

**Gotchas found:** `[ts/test-hang]` (an unterminated `run()` loop with no-op async deps starves vitest's
macrotask timer → uncatchable hang, process-killed at 5 min — two conductor *tests* were wrong, the code was
right; also: a new foreground shell command kills the running background one — killed my own test runs +
orphaned 186 node procs → OOM). `[conductor/wiring]` (the two deferred integration limitations + index.ts is
untested glue by design).

**Next:** thin `api` (Task 27) → parity harness + cross-platform CI (28–29) → P1 DoD. PR `feat/conductor-p1`
awaiting operator-approved merge (Claude-Code classifier blocks self-authored `gh pr merge`).

## s06 — 2026-07-01 — Watchdog + escalate + anti-drift + fingerprint (Tasks 20–23, step 6 done)

**Context:** Continued from s05 (155 tests). Same discipline: sonnet-5 implementers (TDD, no commit) →
controller spec-check vs the PS oracle → whole-module codex GPT-5.5 gate over the combined diff →
adjudicate → fix + regression test → **re-critic the fixes**.

**Built (4 disjoint modules, dispatched in PARALLEL):** Task 20 `watchdog/watchdog.ts` — makes the
`runner.ts` seam real: `runWatched` liveness = newest of (stdout/stderr stream activity, heartbeat mtime,
newest mtime under `activityPaths`), kill whole process tree on stale/hard-timeout; cross-platform tree-kill
(Win `taskkill /T /F`; POSIX detached process-group SIGKILL) + `isRateLimited` (Test-RateLimited parity);
added optional `pollMs` to the seam (backward-compatible). Task 21 `escalate/escalate.ts` — artifact
(verbatim template) + best-effort Telegram/outbox delivery, injected fs/http/env, never-throws, no task-move.
Task 22 `anti-drift/anti-drift.ts` — configurable intent source (whole-file or header-extracted, coupling #4)
+ injected model runner → one digest line; unparseable/failed → UNCERTAIN. Task 23 `util/fingerprint.ts` —
content-keyed SHA256 fence (divergence #3): `snapshot`/`workerTouched`/`strayChanged`/`forbiddenTouches`.
**193 tests / 2 skipped, typecheck clean** (was 155).

**Codex gate (4 findings): 3 accepted, 1 rejected as anti-parity.** ACCEPTED — (F1) anti-drift didn't wrap
the model call → a thrown `runModel` was fail-hard; PS `anti-drift.ps1:82-88` catches → wrapped to UNCERTAIN
+ still writes digest. (F3) `forbiddenTouches` matched the raw path; PS `Test-GlobMatch` normalizes BOTH
sides → a `./`-prefixed forbidden touch was fail-open → normalize before match. (F4) `escalate` env/log reads
were unguarded vs the documented never-throws → `safeLog` + guarded env. REJECTED — (F2) "multiline `/im`
verdict match accepts a later line" is **verbatim `anti-drift.ps1:91` `(?im)^\s*(...)`** — matching the
oracle IS the contract; UNCERTAIN fallback is only for NO-prefix output.

**Re-critic** refuted the F1 fix as incomplete (catch-block logs still unguarded → a throwing logger re-throws
the fail-closed path) → routed all `runAntiDrift` logs through `safeLog` too; confirmed F3/F4 and the F2
rejection. Each fix gated by a regression test.

**Merged:** PR (step 6 batch) → `main`. Codex Windows-sandbox couldn't spawn pwsh/serena
(`CreateProcessAsUserW failed: 5`) but reviewed fine from the inline diff (known gotcha).

**Next:** step 7 — `conductor` wiring (Tasks 24–26), then thin `api` (27), parity harness + CI (28–29).

---

## s05 — 2026-07-01 — Gate group (Tasks 15–19): the correctness core (step 5 done)

**Context:** Continued from s04 (101 tests). Same discipline: sonnet-5 implementers (TDD) →
controller spec-check vs the PS oracle → **whole-module codex GPT-5.5 gate** → adjudicate findings.

**🔴 Resolved before Task 16 (guards/recipe design):** read real `.autodev/GUARDS.md` + recipe files.
Confirmed the table's `contract_value` cell is human-facing (can list `+`-joined siblings) while the
machine per-value key is the recipe's `canonical_value`, and `zone_id` lives ONLY in the recipe. Chose
**(b)**: `guards.ts` is a pure fs-free table parser + selectors over enriched `GuardRecipePair[]`; recipe
loading (fs) is the gate's job. This mirrors the PS split (`Get-AutodevGuards` + `Get-AutodevGuardRecipePairs`
+ pure `Select-*`) exactly — decided from real data, no operator escalation needed (files confirmed the spec).

**Built (all in `src/gate/`):** Task 15 `invariants.ts` (MACHINE-INVARIANTS zod parse, types derived from
schema; `zoneTouched`/`zoneTouchedStrings`/`diffAddedRemovedLines`), Task 16 `guards.ts` (table parser +
per-VALUE `selectGuardForValue` / zone-fallback `selectGuardForZone`), Task 17 `mutation-check.ts`
(GREEN→RED→GREEN, `replaceAll`, byte-exact restore in `finally`, injected runner), Task 18 `gate.ts`
(decision core, exact §4 order, all I/O via `GateDeps`), Task 19 `self-test.test.ts` (5 `gate.ps1 -SelfTest`
cases). Three leaf modules dispatched in PARALLEL (disjoint files). **155 tests / 2 skipped, typecheck clean.**

**Pinned subtle parity from the PS source:** case-sensitivity asymmetry (`zoneTouched` case-INsensitive via
`-match`/`-like`; `zoneTouchedStrings` case-SENSITIVE via `.Contains`); `String.Replace`→`.replaceAll`
(JS `.replace` = first-only, a real bug); empty-file_set fast-path (incl. `!range` guard) BEFORE loaders.

**Codex gate:** correctness core (per-value-no-fallback, case-asymmetry, replaceAll/byte-restore, table
indexing) **confirmed clean**. 3 findings on gate-dependency-failure resilience — **all rejected as
anti-parity**: PS loads invariants/guards before the check too (`gate.ps1:168-170`<`:194`); the `!range`
guard is verbatim `gate.ps1:149`; a broken constitution file isn't worker-fixable (→ conductor fail-closes
to ESCALATE, §2 step 7, not RETRY). Documented the throw/fail-closed contract in `runGate`'s JSDoc.

**Merged (self-merge, operator-confirmed):** PR #10 (gate group) + PR #9 (batch-rule) → `main`. 6 granular
commits. Codex Windows-sandbox couldn't read skill files (`CreateProcessAsUserW failed: 5`) but reviewed
fine from the inline diff (per the known gotcha).

**Next:** step 6 — `watchdog` + `escalate` + `anti-drift` (Tasks 20–23).

---

## s04 — 2026-07-01 — Worker claude-adapter + full critic module (step 3 done, step 4 done)

**Context:** Continued from s03 (PR #1 merged). Same discipline: sonnet-5 implementer (TDD) →
controller spec-check vs parity spec → **codex GPT-5.5 gate per module** → fix subagent + re-critic.
Operator set two durable rules mid-session (→ `AGENTS.md`, memory): **Russian to the operator /
English for all artifacts**, and **the agent always does merges/commits/PRs itself** (operator only
approves a classifier-gated merge). Adopted **per-module PRs** for the rest of P1.

**Built:**
- **Task 11 `worker/claude-adapter`** (PR #3): first live `claude -p` adapter driving the model ladder
  through an injected `WatchedProcessRunner` seam (`src/watchdog/runner.ts`; real watchdog = Task 20).
  Parity §6 exact: contract-zone+429 PAUSE (no downgrade), non-contract+429 step-down, timeout→TIMED_OUT,
  ladder-exhausted→RATE_LIMITED. Transport status only; live path behind `ADH_LIVE=1`.
- **Tasks 12–14 `critic` module** (PR #5): `verdict.ts` (tolerant first-`{`-to-last-`}` parse, strict zod,
  `attachDiffSha256`), `fencing.ts` (physically moves `worker-report.md` out for the codex call,
  non-masking restore), `prompt.ts` (adversarial framing + 4-item checklist + inline diff), `codex-adapter.ts`
  (empty-diff→synthetic clean no-spawn; one fenced `codex exec`; verdict resolution outfile→stdout→exit-code,
  parsed-wins-over-429), `critic-verdict.schema.json`. Two implementer dispatches (12–13 pure, then 14).

**Codex gate earned its keep again:** on the critic module the whole-module gate caught a **High** bug the
subagent's own narrower codex pass missed — a **stale `-o` outfile** readable as this run's verdict across
retry rounds (fixed: `rm` before spawn). Plus `z.number().int()` line parity, non-masking fence restore,
schema-path export guard. All fixed in one pass → **re-critic on the fix diff came back clean**. Weak parts
of findings rejected with reasoning (copy+unlink atomicity redesign; brittle restore-failure test).

**Gotcha logged:** `critic-verdict.schema.json` is not copied to `dist/` by `tsc` — deferred to Task 29.

**Merged (self-merge, operator-authorized):** PR #3, PR #4 (AGENTS.md), PR #5 → `main`. **101 tests passed /
2 skipped, typecheck clean** on `main`.

**Stopped at a clean module boundary (not out of context):** the **gate group (Tasks 15–19)** is the
correctness core and Task 16 `guards` has a genuine design decision to settle first — see CURRENT-STATE
"Open questions". Deliberately deferred to a fresh session rather than improvised.

## s03 — 2026-07-01 — P1 foundation built (subagent-driven + codex gate)

**Context:** Fresh session per the s02 handoff. Operator wired the remote
(`github.com/kalbac/autodev-harness`) and set the coding workflow: **subagent-driven,
worker = sonnet-5, mandatory codex GPT-5.5 critic per module**. Ran mostly autonomously
(operator asleep).

**Setup:**
- Wired `origin`, pushed `main`. **Push to `main` is gated by the safety classifier** → adopted
  PR-flow: all work on `feat/p1-core-loop`, growing **PR #1**. (Correct for our own discipline.)
- Repo hygiene: gitignored `next-session-promt.md` + whole `references/`; untracked
  `references/MANIFEST.md`, preserved its pinned-SHA recipe as tracked `donor-extraction/DONOR-SOURCES.md`.
- Ran `writing-plans` → `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-harness-p1-core-loop.md` (TDD, grounded
  in the parity spec, spec-coverage table).

**Built (build-order steps 1–2 + start of step 3; each = sonnet-5 implementer → I spec-check → codex GPT-5.5 gate → fix subagent):**
- Steps 1–2: Task 0 scaffold (ESM/TS/vitest/zod/yaml), Tasks 1–2 `util/native`+`util/glob`, Task 3 `config`,
  Tasks 4–5 `blackboard` (task parser + file repo = state seam), Tasks 6–7 `util/git`+`worktree`.
- Step 3 (partial): Task 8 `router` (model-ladder resolution); Tasks 9–10 `worker/prompt` + `WorkerAdapter`
  interface + fake adapter. **Task 11 (live `claude` spawn) NOT started** — needs the watchdog seam + live validation.
- **60 tests green, typecheck clean** (independently re-verified in the main context, not just trusted).

**Codex gate earned its keep — real defects caught pre-merge:** stdin-hang + multibyte-UTF-8
corruption (native); non-object-YAML-root + keyless error (config); **exploitable path-traversal via
task id** + frontmatter delimiter anchor + TOCTOU (blackboard); dirty-tree merge + string-based
conflict false-positive + missing `--` arg terminators (git/worktree); `router` was **clean**; verbatim-body
+ fenced prompt regions (worker). Every finding → fix subagent + regression test (weak findings rejected with reasoning, e.g. the worker `.trim()` and JSON-escape suggestions).

**Decisions (minor/reversible, per handoff rule):** license Apache-2.0; config file `.autodev/config.yaml`;
branch renamed `master`→`main`; worktrees via AO pattern (deliberate divergence #1 from PS shared-tree);
`WorkerAdapter` returns TRANSPORT status only (DONE/RATE_LIMITED/TIMED_OUT) — report statuses parsed by the
conductor (parity §6), correcting the plan's mixed `WorkerStatus` sketch.

**Merged:** operator authorized self-merge → **PR #1 merged to `main`** (merge-commit `3c4a7ad`, preserving the
granular feat+codex-fix history as a dogfooding audit trail); branch deleted; 60 tests green on `main`.

**Not done / next:** finish step 3 (`worker` Task 11 claude-adapter via injected watchdog runner) → steps 4–9
(`critic`→`gate`→`watchdog/escalate/anti-drift`→`conductor`→`api`→parity harness+CI). Operator to pick the live
woodev parity target. See `CURRENT-STATE.md` → NEXT ACTIONS. New gotcha: codex-exec Windows sandbox.

## s02 — 2026-07-01 — Pivot, donor extraction, P1 spec

**Context:** New session opened on the day-zero scaffold. Operator corrected direction
before any clone: **stop treating AO as the fork base** — build our *own* harness from the
best of the donor candidates + our proven autodev-loop, in a new repo
`github.com/kalbac/autodev-harness`.

**Method (dogfooding our own discipline):**
- Ran `superpowers:brainstorming`. Locked ambition = **MVP "Loop + UI", architected toward
  product**; stack = **Node LTS + TypeScript** core (headless daemon) + local web UI;
  **file-blackboard = single source of truth**; worker `claude -p` / critic `codex exec`.
- **Donor extraction:** cloned 4 donors into `references/` (git-ignored, pinned SHAs) +
  discovered OpenHands' real code lives in `software-agent-sdk`. Dispatched **5 Sonnet-5
  agents** (4 donors + a parity-spec of our own PS loop) → detailed briefs. Synthesized
  `decision-matrix.md` (🔴 architecture-shaping / 🟡 graftable / ⚪ reject).
- **Proportional codex GPT-5.5 verification** of the 🔴 claims + parity-spec against real
  code: **17/18 CONFIRMED, 1 PARTIAL (AO A3), none refuted.** Matrix → VERIFIED.

**Decisions:**
- `adr/002` — build own harness; AO demoted to one donor. **6 skeleton axes frozen** (state
  blackboard-only + seam / pluggable worker adapter / commit-after-gate / per-worktree /
  independent critic + reject self-critique / declarative model routing).
- Key findings: no donor does complexity routing (ours is best-in-class); AO "chat-scroll
  bug" is a phantom; self-critique (OpenHands in-loop, Open Design Critique Theater) is our
  exact anti-pattern.

**Done:** wrote `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-harness-p1-core-loop-design.md` (P1 core
loop). Updated VISION banner, `adr/002`, CURRENT-STATE, 2 gotchas.

**Not done / next:** `writing-plans` + P1 implementation **deliberately deferred to a fresh
session** (this one's context was full). Create the remote repo first. PS loop continues as
the parity oracle. See `CURRENT-STATE.md` → NEXT ACTIONS.

---

## s01 — 2026-07-01 — Bootstrap & charter

**Context:** Spun out of a woodev-framework orchestrator session. Operator was
evaluating AO (Agent Orchestrator) as a replacement/complement for our
project-bound `autodev-loop` and hit its limits: no per-task model routing, no
critic-reviewer setting, and a chat-scroll bug in the desktop UI.

**Decisions:**
- **Fork AO** rather than wait for upstream to grow our features (`adr/001`).
- Project name **Autodev Harness**; slogan *"Let agents code, but never let them
  merge bullshit."*
- **Single source of truth = AO's session/PR model.** Port autodev-loop's
  *policies* (critic gate, contract-zone guards, model routing, anti-drift), drop
  its *plumbing* (PowerShell conductor, file-queue blackboard).
- Build in three ROI-ordered tiers (Tier-0 orchestrator-driven → Tier-1 small fork
  changes → Tier-2 deep native). Tier-1 = `--model` per-task, scroll-bug fix,
  critic kanban column.

**Done:**
- Scaffolded `docs/` with the proven woodev-framework structure.
- Wrote `VISION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CURRENT-STATE.md`, `AGENT-RULES.md`,
  `DOCS-INDEX.md`, `DOCS-SCHEMA.md`, `GOTCHAS.md`, `FUTURE-BACKLOG.md`, `adr/001`.
- Ported crown reference docs: `reference/autodev-loop-runbook.md`,
  `reference/ao-codex-critic-protocol.md`.
- `git init` + initial commit.

**Not done / next:** AO source not cloned yet. Next session: clone AO, set up
fork hygiene (upstream remote), scope Tier-1 with real effort numbers. See
`CURRENT-STATE.md` → NEXT ACTIONS.
