# 003 — Roles are a configurable model matrix; the orchestrator is an in-harness LLM

**Status:** proposed (operator clarification, s04 2026-07-01 — explicitly "discussable, not a hard rule")
**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Refines:** frozen-skeleton axis 2 (pluggable `WorkerAdapter`/`CriticAdapter`) and axis 6
(routing) from `002-build-own-harness-not-fork-ao.md`. Does not supersede them — extends
the adapter model from a fixed `claude`-worker + `codex`-critic pair into a general
role×model matrix, and adds an LLM orchestrator layer the parity spec does not have.

## Context

The port so far followed the autodev-loop parity spec, which hard-wires **worker = Claude,
critic = codex (non-Claude, heterogeneity "load-bearing"), conductor = pure PowerShell with
zero LLM calls**. Building `ClaudeWorkerAdapter` and `CodexCriticAdapter` first made it look
as though the harness bakes in "codex = critic, Claude = worker."

The operator clarified the intended model (s04): the harness must **not** bind a vendor to a
role. Per project, the operator chooses which model fills each role. Worker could be DeepSeek,
critic could be Claude, orchestrator could be codex. Concretely, as the operator described it:

- Global settings define a **default model per role** (orchestrator, worker, critic, planner, …).
- Creating/opening a **project** exposes the same knobs as **per-project overrides**.
- The operator, by default, has **one window: the orchestrator**, and talks only to it. The
  orchestrator assigns tasks to workers, launches the critic, watches the run, reports back,
  and manages the kanban.
- The operator can also open a window onto an already-running worker/critic/planner and talk
  to it directly, and can spawn a worker directly via "New task" (the AO pattern).

**Framing the operator gave (the intent behind this):** globally, the orchestrator role and
the autodev discipline do not change from autodev-loop — only the packaging does. Before, the
operator launched a Claude Code session in the project terminal and said "use autodev-loop to
implement task X"; now the operator just opens the harness and says "implement task X", and the
orchestrator already knows it is inside autodev. The wiring becomes implicit instead of a manual
instruction. Crucially, the discipline the orchestrator "obeys" is two things: (1) a soft
*protocol* layer it follows as an agent, and (2) a hard, un-bypassable *deterministic gate* —
in autodev-loop the gate ran in PowerShell, not in the operator's Claude session, so the agent
physically could not talk past it. That mechanical guarantee (not the agent's good behavior) is
what makes "never merge bullshit" hold — and it maps directly onto the two-layer split below.

## Decision

**Roles are a first-class, open set (`orchestrator`, `worker`, `critic`, `planner`, …), each
mapped to a configurable model via a global default + per-project override. No vendor is bound
to a role. Adapters are role-interface implementations selected from a registry by config.**

To preserve the project thesis ("never let agents merge bullshit") under an LLM orchestrator,
the system is split into two layers:

1. **Enforcement substrate — deterministic, no LLM judgment.** worktree isolation, the machine
   `gate` + `guards` + `mutation-check`, the dirty-file fence, the critic-gate invocation, and
   commit-after-gate. This is the parity-spec conductor's machinery (plan Tasks 15–26). An LLM
   **cannot talk its way past it.** This layer is vendor- and role-agnostic and is needed in
   every version of the vision — so it is built **now** (gate group is next), unchanged.
2. **Orchestrator layer — an LLM, conversational.** The operator-facing agent that authors and
   prioritizes tasks, **triggers** the enforcement loop, monitors, reports, and drives the
   kanban. New relative to autodev-loop (there the orchestrator was the operator's external
   Claude session). It sits **above** the enforcement substrate but cannot override the gate.

Supporting mechanics:
- **Role registry + config-driven selection.** `worker/critic/…` adapters resolve from a
  registry by a configured vendor id; role→model mapping is config, not code. Introduced when
  the `conductor`/config is wired (plan Task 24 + config), informed by this ADR.
- **Per-adapter config.** Vendor-shaped knobs move under their adapter: today's global
  `worker.ladder = [opus,sonnet,haiku]` (Claude-shaped) and `critic.effort/model` (codex-shaped)
  become per-adapter settings so a DeepSeek worker or a Claude critic each carry their own.
- **Heterogeneity is a policy, not a vendor lock.** autodev-loop's "critic must differ from the
  worker family" becomes an operator-configurable policy (default on; at most a warning when
  worker and critic share a family), never a hardcoded "critic = codex."

## What this does NOT change

- The already-merged `WorkerAdapter`/`CriticAdapter` **interfaces are correct** — they are
  role-based and vendor-agnostic. `ClaudeWorkerAdapter`/`CodexCriticAdapter` remain valid MVP
  role-implementations; they are not a vendor lock, just the first two of a matrix.
- The gate/enforcement work proceeds unchanged and first (it is the substrate).
- The file-blackboard remains the single source of truth (axis 1).

## Open questions (to resolve with the operator before implementing the orchestrator layer)

1. **Orchestrator vs deterministic conductor boundary:** confirm the orchestrator LLM only
   *triggers/oversees* the deterministic loop (recommended — preserves the gate), rather than
   performing loop steps as judgment calls.
2. **Where the orchestrator lives:** a long-lived agent session per project inside the daemon;
   its transcript/window model (ties into the P2 multi-window UI + AO's session model).
3. **`planner` role scope:** what the planner does vs the orchestrator (task decomposition?).
4. **Config shape:** the global-defaults + per-project-override schema for role→model, and how
   it coexists with `.autodev/config.yaml`.

## Consequences

- The plan's `conductor` (Tasks 24–26) stays as the deterministic engine; an **orchestrator**
  layer is added on top (new tasks, likely alongside/after the P2 UI, since it is
  window/session-shaped). CURRENT-STATE tracks this.
- The adapter/role-registry + per-adapter config generalization is scheduled at the config +
  conductor stage, not retrofitted into the gate work.
